Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that\\'s just my luck.

      "{'text': 'doesn\\'t work with iphone 4 bumper- but price is right\\nThe Philips DC291 has an impressive list of features that had me quite interested.  Having iPhones, iPods, and an iPad 2, the compatibility with Apple products was a major draw.  Overall I was pleased with how these features worked.  There are some flaws (which I will detail below) but for the relatively low price, I\\'m willing to forgive these failings.PROsHandsome alarm clock is sleek and modern looking.Sound is very good and very loud for the size.The included remote control works well for basic navigation of your playlist.Time is automatically set when your iPhone/iPad/whatever is plugged into it.CONsThe numbers in the time display on the LCD screen are too small (&lt; 1 inch tall).The viewing angle of the LCD display is really bad.iPhone 4 will not dock with Apple Bumper installed.iPhone 4 gives sporadic error messages when docked.iPhone 4---------------The first device that I tried was my iPhone 4.  Mine has the Apple bumper installed and when I docked the iPhone, nothing happened.  The phone seemed firmly attached to the clock but the battery wasn\\'t charging and I couldn\\'t get any music to play through the clock.On a hunch, I removed the Apple Bumper from my iPhone and tried again.  This time it immediately made the \"charging\" sound and any music I played on the iPhone played through the clock speakers.In addition to using the standard \"iPod\" app, I was also able to play the Sirius satellite radio app and Pandora apps through the speakers.  The included remote control was able to pause/fast forward in the iPod and Pandora app but not in the Sirius app.  I believe this is a limitation of the Sirius app.One concern was periodic error messages that were displayed on my iPhone 4 while it was docked.  I repeatedly saw \"Charging is not supported with this accessory.\" and \"This accessory is not optimized for this iphone.\"  While these messages displayed on the iPhone, it continued to operate fine.  I\\'m not sure what to make of these error messages but they didn\\'t give me a good feeling.  These errors generally popped up when I was fiddling with the iPhone (navigating through menus, etc...) so I assume they are due to the connection getting jiggled.iPod Touch---------------My iPod touch docked perfectly and worked flawlessly with the DC291.  Functionality was identical to my iPhone 4.  When docked, the iPod touch charged and played local music, Pandora, and Sirius through the speakers without any problems.  I haven\\'t yet seen any sporadic messages from the iPod touch.iPod (2nd Generation)---------------It\\'s a marvelous feat of engineering that my trusty gen-2 iPod features the same connector as a modern iPad.  As I expected, I plugged the old gen-2 iPod in and was able to play music.  Unfortunately, many years ago, Apple changed the way that power is provided through the connector.  This dock is unable to charge an old iPod which makes it fairly useless.  This is not a surprise to me as no recent devices I\\'ve seen are able to charge these old Firewire-based iPods.  But music playback was fine.iPad 2---------------The Philips dock works great with my wife\\'s iPad 2.  The small plastic support tab that protrudes from the back of the docking station provides just enough support so that the iPad is solidly anchored.The iPad worked fine and even could be attached with Apple\\'s magnet cover attached in the \"open\" position (wrapped around the back).One curiosity was not an iPad problem or an issue with the docking station- the SiriusXM app will ONLY run in landscape mode on the iPad 2.  This means it is always sideways when used from the docking station.  I consider this a flaw in the SiriusXM app, not in the docking station!Speakers---------------The speakers on this clock are quite clear and surprisingly loud for the size.  The bass is poor but that was expected.  What wasn\\'t expected is just how loud I could crank this thing.  I was also surprised that the speaker did not distort as I turned it up uncomfortably loud.  While these are not in the same league as one of my favorites, Klipsch, I was quite pleased with the performance of the speakers.Clock---------------The display on the DC291 is the biggest source of disappointment.  It\\'s unacceptable in my opinion because the size of the clock numerals is less than 1\" tall and the viewing angle is terrible.  When standing in front of the clock, it is impossible to read the time because of the viewing angle limitations.  The same is true for trying to view from the side: everything just fades away.  In an age of retina displays, this clock features a display with 1980s era technology.  Fortunately, this product is marketed more as a docking solution so I think the clock features are somewhat secondary.I loved that the clock set it\\'s time to match my iPhone or iPod.  Setting clocks is sometimes a tedious affair but this was very easy.The battery backup feature seems to work well.  To conserve the battery, when power is removed, the display turns off.  Pressing any button will cause the time to briefly display.  When power is restored, the time and all settings are preserved.  You cannot use or charge your iPod/iPhone when on battery power; that is not a surprise!!I love that I can set the alarm to only go off on weekdays or weekends.  I think for most people, this is a great feature.  Also, I appreciate being able to choose from my playlist, the FM radio, or the buzzer for sound to wake up to.  You also get to pick the volume of the alarm so if you are listening to the radio loudly during the day, you won\\'t be jarred awake by the volume being too high in the morning.  This is a thoughtful feature.Miscellaneous---------------During normal operation, I measured the DC291 as using less than 1 watt of electricity.  This is consistent with other digital alarm clocks in my house.  At least you can know that it\\'s not costing you money!

      "{'text': 'window mount is bad, not as intuitive as I would like\\n(You may notice this review is very similar to my review of the TomTom VIA1505.  These are very similar devices so I\\'ve copied large portions of the reviews but made adjustments where appropriate.)My wife has been harping me for a GPS in her car for some time. After a recent stint in a loaner car equipped with a factory GPS, I began searching in earnest for a good GPS to fill the need. I originally was looking at the Garmin Nuvi line but some of reviews commented on \"commercials\" appearing when the driver is stopped and I was totally unwilling to pay top dollar for a GPS just for the privilege of staring at advertisements. When I saw the new GO and VIA lines from TomTom I decided to take a closer look.I ended up picking up both a GO2535TM and a VIA1505. The GO model is more of a \"top of the line\" model compared to the mid-grade VIA1505. I\\'ll talk about some of the differences below but first let me give a brief summary of my findings with the 2535:Pros:Very affordable.Useful traffic updates (for free!)Lifetime free map updatesVery fast re-routing.Very large screen.Nice size.Really helpful intersection detail screens pop up when going through a route.No problem with polarized sunglasses.Cons:Vehicle mount is not well built and cannot hold unit upright for long (sags).Screen washes out badly in the Texas sun.Battery life is less than 90 minutes.Speed limit data is often inaccurate.User interface is kind of slow.MyTomTom service is a bit kludgy.Very slow acquisition of GPS signal (> 90 seconds)FORM FACTORThe GO2535 is a very svelte GPS with a large screen.MYTOMTOM SOFTWAREThe MyTomTom software is run through your web browser.  It works on a Macintosh or Windows and requires you to first register your device with an e-mail address.  Once registered, when you plug your device in, a helper tool will recognize it and open your web browser and then show you the available updates.  I don\\'t really care for how it works (would rather have a dedicated application like Garmin) but it does work fine.SCREENI took the GPS out to my car to go for a spin. I was immediately pleased to see that my polarized sunglasses did not interfere with screen visibility. Unfortunately, when I stepped outside of my house, the Texas sun so badly washed out the display that I thought something was wrong. I stepped into my dark garage and suddenly the screen was clearly visible again. I went into the settings to make sure there weren\\'t any power saving options or screen brightness settings that needing adjustment- there were not.Once I mounted the GPS in my car and started driving around, I continued to find the screen (on battery power) to be barely visible. On a hunch, I plugged in the (included) 12volt adapter cord and suddenly the screen became noticeably brighter. It still wasn\\'t great, but it was at least visible even in the bright sunlight. I later learned that the battery life on this unit is so bad that I have to leave it plugged in all the time anyway.VEHICLE MOUNTThe vehicle mount is slick.  The unit rests in place held by magnets.  The connector itself cinches up with a magnetic pull so you don\\'t even have to do any work to connect things- very clever.  This makes it very easy to remove your device and reinstall it.Unfortunately, the ball-joint for this unit is not well engineered and over a period of 60 days, it gets so loose it can no longer hold the GPS upright.  I\\'ve now gone through TWO of these vehicles mounts (TomTom was kind enough to send me a replacement after the first one started sagging).  The ball joint tension is not adjustable I have no confidence that this thing will ever hold up for more than a month or two.  This is a major reason why this GPS gets 2 stars.USER INTERFACEI entered a few destinations using the built in search feature. It was reasonably easy to find restaurants and other points of interest near my house. I was a bit perplexed by how slow the interface was- when I pushed a key on the virtual keyboard there was usually a noticeable delay. The delay was so long that sometimes I ended up pushing the same key multiple times before the letter showed up on the screen.Overall I find the user interface to be a bit non-intuitive.  At the very least it seems to require too many clicks to do basic things like finding a restaurant.  That coupled with the slight sluggishness really detracts from this unit.BATTERYWith a full charge, I\\'ve been getting less than 90 minutes of battery life. I haven\\'t actually used the unit until the battery totally expires but I have seen the low battery warning come on well before the 90 minute mark. This is a bit annoying as it means you realistically have to leave it plugged in most of the time. Due to the screen brightness issue, I\\'m having to leave it plugged in anyway.GPS SIGNAL ACQUISITIONThe first time I left my house, I was puzzled because the GPS wasn\\'t showing any movement. I drove out of my neighborhood and to a nearby stoplight. This is about a 90 second drive. During this time the GPS said it was \"acquiring GPS signal\". Finally, while sitting at the stoplight, the GPS updated and correctly showed my location for the remainder of my drive. This initial acquisition was a lot slower than I expected. Sometimes when I\\'m downtown at a baseball game I want to quickly figure out how to get home. If I have to wait 90 seconds to get a GPS signal, I\\'ll be driving blind for quite some time before I get any guidance as to which one-way street is going to take me to the desired interstate. If I sit in my car for 90 seconds, tons of fans pour into the streets and cause endless backups. I\\'m pretty disappointed with this and am hoping it improves with firmware updates.SPEED LIMIT DISPLAYOne feature of the GO2535 is that it displays posted speed limits on major roads. Unfortunately, I estimate that 25% of the speed limits in the GO2535 are inaccurate. In many cases the posted speeds are slower than what the GPS displays. This is a recipe for a speeding ticket! In the end, I find that I can\\'t trust and have to ignore these speed limits. I wish there was a way to hide them altogether since they can\\'t be depended on. Both my VIA1505 and GO2535TM have this issue so it seems to be something in TomTom\\'s data feed.POINTS OF INTERESTI configured my GO2535 to display restaurants and gas stations along my route. I found that it was a bit spotty. There were several gas stations (Citgo, Valero and even some Shell stations) that I drove by that did not appear on my map. Several Chevrons did show up. Likewise with restaurants, the TomTom was missing a Burger King, Jack in the Box and Chick-fil-a however it showed me several McDonalds and Sonics. I did not notice any \"small\" restaurants showing up on the GPS. Good luck finding a hole-in-the-wall gem with the TomTom. I\\'m not surprised or disappointed by that- just reporting the facts.NAVIGATION GUIDESWhere this unit really shines is in the most basic feature of taking you to a destination. First, I love the custom intersection and highway exit screens that come up to tell you which direction each lane can go. At one point I was on a 7-lane stretch of freeway and the TomTom dutifully drew all 7 lanes with arrows showing where they were headed (veering right, going straight, etc...). Very cool and very confidence inspiring! I love this feature.REROUTINGAlso, this unit is very fast at recalculating routes. Even on a 60 minute drive, any slight change in my route resulted in a reroute in just a matter of seconds. I\\'ve read other GPS units taking 60-90 seconds to calculate a new route. Clearly this is not an issue for the GO2535.  My wife also commented on how quickly the unit rerouted when she altered her route. This is a very important feature and one at which the GO2535 excels.IQ ROUTESAnother feature that seems to work as advertised is the \"IQ Routes\" that allow the GO2535 to route you around predicted traffic jams. If I leave work at lunch time, it will take me home via one route. If I leave at 5:30, it takes me another route that completely bypasses a huge backup with the first route. This is a great feature to have given that this product does not have any traffic updates.SUMMARYThe sluggish response when interacting with the unit, the not-as-intuitive-as-I-hoped-for user interface, and the sagging window mount have me not really caring for this GPS.  I lost it after less than 6 months of ownership (very careless!!!) and I replaced it with a Garmin 3490LMT which so far seems like a far superior product.', 'rating': 2, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['speeds', 'slower', 'In many cases the posted speeds are slower than what the GPS displays', 1], ['signal', 'second', 'Very slow acquisition of GPS signal (> 90 seconds)FORM FACTORThe GO2535 is a very svelte GPS with a large screen', 1], ['unit', 'real', 'NAVIGATION GUIDESWhere this unit really shines is in the most basic feature of taking you to a destination', 1], ['charge', 'full', 'BATTERYWith a full charge', 1], ['product', 'super', ') and I replaced it with a Garmin 3490LMT which so far seems like a far superior product', 1], ['feature', 'important', 'This is a very important feature and one at which the GO2535 excels', 1], ['devices', 'similar', \"These are very similar devices so I've copied large portions of the reviews but made adjustments where appropriate\", 1], ['screen', 'clear', 'I stepped into my dark garage and suddenly the screen was clearly visible again', 1], ['screen', 'large', 'Very large screen', 1], ['drive', 'second', 'This is about a 90 second drive', -1], ['interface', 'slow', 'I was a bit perplexed by how slow the interface was- when I pushed a key on the virtual keyboard there was usually a noticeable delay', -1]], 'item': 'B004MYFTD8'}\n",
      "{'text': 'Excellent sound!\\nThis speaker delivers excellent sound in a very reasonably sized package.  A melodic guitar solo sounded so real, I could hear every pluck of the strings.  This is the best-sounding iPhone dock speaker that I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of using.PROs+ Excellent sound quality.+ Reasonably small.+ Attractive design with retractable dock connector to keep things sleek.+ AirPlay audio is easy to setup and works well.CONs- Big external power brick.SETUPIf you are going to dock your Apple iPod/iPhone/iPad, setup is as simple as \"ejecting\" the hidden dock retractor and docking your device.  I tested with an iPhone 4 with the Apple bumper installed and the fit was excellent.  Many dock connectors are not compatible with the iPhone bumper but that is not the problem with this unit.The one-time setup of adding this to your wireless network for AirPlay was very easy.  I used the \"WPS\" feature of the speaker which allowed me to join the speaker to my secured Wifi network by just pushing a button on the speaker and then the matching WPS button on my wifi router.  I didn\\'t have to do anything after that except to wait a minute or so.  You only have to do this setup once but I\\'m pleased to say that Sony made it very easy.  I think most people will be able to figure this out.SOUND QUALITYI was impressed with the quality of this speaker.  Highs were crisp, bass was strong and clear without being muddy.  As for volume, it is able to play painfully loud in a bedroom-sized room.  I think the sound quality is the biggest win with this product.  I enjoy listening to it every time I use it.D-Sappli iOS APPI downloaded Sony\\'s free D-Sappli app from the Apple app store.  When my phone is docked, I can run this app and have my dock act like a semi-intelligent alarm clock.  You can setup a range of times for it to play (start time, end time, and list of songs).  You can also set it to perform a sleep function where it will play for 15+ minutes and then go silent.There is also an equalizer feature available that lets you choose from sound presets like \"Rock\".  It works well and may help you improve audio depending on your personal preferences.APPEARANCEThis unit has clean lines and a rounded triangular form.  It is mostly black with a small stainless-steel-look bezel on the top and a retractable dock connector.  The retractable connector allows it to look great even when you\\'re not connecting your iPhone through the dock.  I was pleased with the appearance and would have no problem putting this in a prominent location.MISCELLANEOUSThe unit comes with an obligatory minuscule remote control that you will probably lose.  It also comes with a huge power brick that somewhat disappointed me.  I suppose you can hide the brick behind it but it is about the size of a brick for a small laptop.  The power brick is my only minor gripe about this speaker.An annoying feature of this unit is the auto-off feature that happens after 20 minutes of non-use.  I later learned that this can be avoided by configure the speaker to go into \"network standby\".  That made my enjoyment of this speaker so much higher!  I can\\'t believe \"network standby\" isn\\'t the default setting.SUMMARYIf you\\'re ok with dropping nearly $400 on a speaker, this is definitely one to consider.  It undercuts the Bose SoundDock-10 and the B&W; Zeppelin by more than $100 yet still delivers excellent sound quality.  If the unit had bluetooth and a battery it would be close to the ultimate dock speaker.', 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['sound quality', 'excellent', 'Zeppelin by more than $100 yet still delivers excellent sound quality', 1], ['feature', 'available', 'There is also an equalizer feature available that lets you choose from sound presets like \"Rock\"', 1], ['audio', 'easy', '+ AirPlay audio is easy to setup and works well', 1], ['fit', 'excellent', 'I tested with an iPhone 4 with the Apple bumper installed and the fit was excellent', 1], ['connectors', 'compatible', 'Many dock connectors are not compatible with the iPhone bumper but that is not the problem with this unit', -1]], 'item': 'B007JCNOHS'}\n",
      "{'text': 'Insane performance boost for 2009 MacBook Pro\\nI\\'ve been watching SSD technology for ages but held off due to high prices and small capacities.  With the recent Gold Box deal on the 2011 SanDisk Extreme SSDs, the price of the 480GiB SSD was finally right and I took the plunge.The goal with this drive was to replace the 250GB system drive of my 2009 MacBook Pro and replace it with a 480GiB SSD.  This proved trivial.  I did a time machine backup for safety and then mounted the SSD in an external USB drive carrier.  I then used the *free* Smart Copy Clone software to \"clone\" my 250GB drive to the SSD over a USB connection.  That took about 3 hours for 150GB of content.  When complete, I shut down the computer, took it apart, removed the old drive, slid in the SanDisk Extreme drive, put it back together and turned it on: ta da!The performance difference on my now 3-year old MacBook Pro is staggering.  Booting the system happens in mere seconds.  Loading my 200GB aperture library takes 4 seconds.  Launching the ever-slow Microsoft Word 2011 takes less than 3 seconds.  Launching the Chrome web browser is instantaneous.  The impact is so severe that I will NEVER own another computer that does not use SSD technology.  Based on this upgrade, I expect to get several more years of usage out of this machine.  Previously I had planned on replacing it in the summer of 2012 or possibly holding off until 2013 at the latest.BTW, if you\\'ve got an older MacBook Pro, take the time to install 8GB of RAM.

      "{'text': 'works great, easy to setup\\nThe Harmony Ultimate is a fantastic universal remote that is extremely easy to setup while still being very flexible.PROs-----------------------+ very easy to setup+ fits nicely in hand+ long-tap feature allows you to hold a button down and get a different behavior+ comes with a recharging stand and built-in rechargeable battery+ handles pretty much any equipment you can throw at it (including old equipment from 2002)+ motion sensor; remote lights up when you pick it upCONs------------------------ all your config is stored \"in the cloud\"SETUP-----------------------Upon attaching the remote to my computer for configuration, the screen of the remote lit up with only this: \"myharmony.com\".  I went to that site and it had me create an account and install a small app on my Windows 7 system.  From there, it started asking me if I wanted to import a preexisting remote\\'s configurations onto my Harmony Ultimate.  If I had a previous Harmony remote, I think I would have been almost done at that point.  Because this is my first Harmony, I had to go through a series of screens to answer questions about my TV and AVR setup.  I entered the names of the devices in my system:Panasonic TC-P65VT50 (TV)DirecTV HR34 (DVR)Denon AVR-5803 (AVR)Panasonic DMP-BD60 (Blu-ray)It asked a few simple questions about how they were connected and configured (in most cases guessing correctly).  From there, it generated a configuration and pushed it to the remote control.  While at it, it performed a firmware upgrade on my remote.  It also asked me which WIFI network the remote should use.  After that, I disconnected the remote and everything worked perfectly on the first try!!!After some playing around, I decided to add the ability to put my TV into Internet mode as a new option  in the remote.  After I made that change on the myharmony.com website, I didn\\'t even have to attach my remote to the computer to to make it work.  I just went to the remote and chose \"sync settings\" and it pulled my configuration from harmony\\'s website (\"the cloud\").  Very slick!USAGE-----------------------When you pick up the remote, it automatically lights up and turns on the touch screen.  On the touch screen options are displayed like \"Watch TV\" or \"Watch Blu-ray\".  When you click on one of those, all of the devices in your system turn on as required and change inputs automatically.  From there, most usage is done with the \"hard\" buttons for things like volume up/down/mute, channel changing, or navigating your DVR guide.The remote fits nicely in my hand and has a comfortable ridge across the back that allows it to position itself correctly in your hand.To reach a compromise between too many buttons and not enough buttons, Logitech came up with a neat idea.  If you press and hold a button for an instant longer than normal, the button purpose will change.  For example, if I hit the \"fast forward\" button for an instant, the button will put my DVR or blu-ray player into fast-forward mode.  But if I hold the button for just a tad longer, the remote will vibrate and instead send the \"skip ahead\" command to jump forward.  This allows Logitech to get rid of buttons that aren\\'t quite as useful while still giving you the ability to quickly reach those features.  This is a great innovation and was a key for me.  I had read negative reviews on the Harmony Touch and this feature seems to address those complaints.  Using the long-hold proved annoying after awhile so I just went ahead and reassigned some lesser-used buttons to do the skip-ahead/skip back-functionality.RF support is important for me because some of my equipment is positioned out of sight.  Using the included smart control hub, I am able to use included IR blasters to reach IR equipment that is not reachable by the remote.  So far RF support has worked flawlessly and required zero setup.The remote comes with an upright charging cradle.  Logitech advises you to always dock your remote when not in use so that you always have a full charge.IPHONE APP-----------------------The Harmony Control app for the iPhone works as you\\'d expect.  When you launch it, it detects your smart controller and immediately offers you a view of the remote consistent with your custom configuration.  The control is very responsive and you can do anything from the phone that you could have done from the remote in hand.  Because you have to have your iPhone in hand and turned on, I don\\'t find this feature important for me.SUMMARY-----------------------I waited a long time for this remote and it has proven worth the wait.  So far I\\'ve found nothing that I can complain about.  It was easy to setup and works great.

It\\'s so thin and light (with such a big screen) that you can\\'t help but recognize it features the very latest technologies.  The price of the VIA1505 is low enough that I am willing to forgive many of the flaws I\\'m about to describe.MYTOMTOM SOFTWAREThe first thing I will comment about is the MyTomTom application that one uses to perform all firmware and map updates.  TomTom is kind enough to provide an initial free map update for the VIA1505 through the MyTomTom application.  I installed the MyTomTom app on both a Macintosh and a Windows 7 system.  The UI was similar on both computers and I didn\\'t detect any difference in the quality or features.  The application had an annoying tendancy to keep launching even though I had changed the setting to tell it not to launch each time I turned on my computer.  That is the first of many bugs.I initially activated my TomTom GO2535TM.  This went smoothly however it did not find any map updates.  I then tried to add the VIA1505 to my account but I received a very cryptic error \"something has gone wrong\".  I\\'m serious, that was the error message.  I googled but could not find anything.  I tried about a dozen times and continued to get this error.  I tried on both the Mac and Windows and continued to get the error.  Finally I thought \"maybe I need to create a separate login on MyTomTom for the second GPS?\".  Upon creating a second login on the TomTom website, the VIA1505 linked without error and proceeded to download firmware and map updates.  Of course, this leads me to wonder why my GO2535TM is not seeing map updates!Over the first 6 months of ownership, the MyTomTom software was updated several times and now works fine.  I still don\\'t like the design that requires it to work from a web browser with a special login account on tomtom.com.  Why can\\'t their update process simply take the serial number of my device, and deliver the appropriate updates to me?SCREENI took the GPS out to my car to go for a spin.  I was immediately pleased to see that my polarized sunglasses did not interfere with screen visibility.  Unfortunately, when I stepped outside of my house, the Texas sun so badly washed out the display that I thought something was wrong.

I later learned that the battery life on this unit is so bad that I have to leave it plugged in all the time anyway.VEHICLE MOUNTThe suction cup mount for this unit is permanently affixed to the GPS screen.  This means you have to re-stick it to your windshield each time you get in your car.  This unit is inexpensive enough that you might be tempted to leave it mounted in the car  all the time but I talk to SO many people that have had their car broken into for GPS units- it seems like it\\'s not worth the risk of broken windows/doorlocks to leave it mounted.  Because of the design, unmounting and mounting each time is definitely a lot harder than you\\'d expect.  My GO2535TM has a magnetic removable mount that is much nicer.USER INTERFACEI entered a few destinations using the built in search feature.  It was reasonably easy to find restaurants and other points of interest near my house.  I was a bit perplexed by how slow the interface was- when I pushed a key on the virtual keyboard there was usually a noticeable delay.  The delay was so long that sometimes I ended up pushing the same key multiple times before the letter showed up on the screen.  This took some getting used to and seems like it could be fixed with better tuned firmware in the future.  I\\'m crossing my fingers!BATTERYWith a full charge, I\\'ve been getting less than 90 minutes of battery life.  I haven\\'t actually used the unit until the battery totally expires but I have seen the low battery warning come on well before the 90 minute mark.

In the end, I find that I can\\'t trust and have to ignore these speed limits.  I wish there was a way to hide them altogether since they can\\'t be depended on.  Both my VIA1505 and GO2535TM have this issue so it seems to be something in TomTom\\'s data feed.POINTS OF INTERESTI configured my VIA1505 to display restaurants and gas stations along my route.  I found that it was a bit spotty.  There were several gas stations (Citgo, Valero and even some Shell stations) that I drove by that did not appear on my map.  Several Chevrons did show up.  Likewise with restaurants, the TomTom was missing a Burger King, Jack in the Box and Chick-fil-a however it showed me several McDonalds and Sonics.  I did not notice any \"small\" restaurants showing up on the GPS.  Good luck finding a hole-in-the-wall gem with the TomTom.  I\\'m not surprised or disappointed by that- just reporting the facts.NAVIGATION GUIDESWhere this unit really shines is in the most basic feature of taking you to a destination.  First, I love the custom intersection and highway exit screens that come up to tell you which direction each lane can go.  At one point I was on a 7-lane stretch of freeway and the TomTom dutifully drew all 7 lanes with arrows showing where they were headed (veering right, going straight, etc...).  Very cool and very confidence inspiring!  I love this feature.REROUTINGAlso, this unit is very fast at recalculating routes.  Even on a 60 minute drive, any slight change in my route resulted in a reroute in just a matter of seconds.  I\\'ve read other GPS units taking 60-90 seconds to calculate a new route.  Clearly this is not an issue for the VIA1505.  My wife also commented on how quickly the unit rerouted when she altered her route.  This is a very important feature and one at which the VIA1505 excels.IQ ROUTESAnother feature that seems to work as advertised is the \"IQ Routes\" that allow the VIA1505 to route you around predicted traffic jams.  If I leave work at lunch time, it will take me home via one route.  If I leave at 5:30, it takes me another route that completely bypasses a huge backup with the first route.  This is a great feature to have given that this product does not have any traffic updates.SUMMARYAll told, I love my GO2535TM and am fairly neutral on the VIA1505.  The lousy screen and lousy mounting options really detract from this otherwise fine product.  For 70% more (about $100), the TomTom GO2535TM has a beautiful glass screen that shines brightly and a nifty magnetic mount that allows for easy snap-in/out.  If the VIA1505 wasn\\'t so cheap, I\\'d probably return it for another GO2535TM.  As it is, it\\'s just cheap and good enough that it will likely earn a permanent spot in my car.If any meaningful updates occur, I\\'ll modify my review.', 'rating': 3, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['signal', 'second', 'Very slow acquisition of GPS signal (> 90 seconds)FORM FACTORThe VIA1505 is a very svelte GPS with a large screen', 1], ['fix', 'better', 'This took some getting used to and seems like it could be fixed with better tuned firmware in the future', 1], ['charge', 'full', 'BATTERYWith a full charge', 1], ['unit', 'real', 'NAVIGATION GUIDESWhere this unit really shines is in the most basic feature of taking you to a destination', 1], ['feature', 'important', 'This is a very important feature and one at which the VIA1505 excels', 1], ['speeds', 'slower', 'In many cases the posted speeds are slower than what the GPS displays', 1], ['screen', 'big', \"It's so thin and light (with such a big screen) that you can't help but recognize it features the very latest technologies\", 1], ['screen', 'large', 'Very large screen', 1], ['screen', 'clear', 'I stepped into my dark garage and suddenly the screen was clearly visible again', 1], ['screen', 'beautiful', 'the TomTom GO2535TM has a beautiful glass screen that shines brightly and a nifty magnetic mount that allows for easy snap-in/out', 1], ['drive', 'second', 'This is about a 90 second drive', -1], ['interface', 'slow', 'I was a bit perplexed by how slow the interface was- when I pushed a key on the virtual keyboard there was usually a noticeable delay', -1], ['screen', 'lousy', 'The lousy screen and lousy mounting options really detract from this otherwise fine product', -1]], 'item': 'B004J4VYEY'}\n",
      "{'text': 'blazing fast upgrade\\nIf your laptop has a standard hard drive, there is very likely nothing you can do to it that will improve the performance as much as adding an SSD drive such as this SanDisk Extreme II.  Modern computer architectures have an abundance of CPU cores and clock cycles, fast and plentiful RAM, but are still hamstrung by hard drive technology that hasn\\'t really sped up much over the last 15 years.  The result is that (by far) the slowest component in your laptop is the hard drive.With SSDs being a newer technology, there is concern over their reliability.  Because I\\'ve owned and abused two 2012 SanDisk Extreme 480GB SSDs for the last 12 months without any problems,  I have a strong expectation that the 2013 SanDisk Extreme II will provide fast and reliable storage.PERFORMANCE-----------------------------I was stunned by how much faster SSD drives made my aging MacBook Pro so I was excited to finally add this technology to my Windows 7 laptop.  I did some before-and-after benchmarks to help you understand just what a huge impact an SSD drive will have on your system.  My previous hard drive was a very fast 7200RPM drive.  Many laptops ship with even slower 5400RPM.Launch Outlook 2010Hard Drive: 3.0 secondsExtreme II SSD: 1.2 seconds (2.5x faster)Launch VMWare WorkstationHard Drive: 15 secondsExtreme II SSD: 4 seconds (3.8x faster)Boot Windows 7Hard Drive: 48 secondsExtreme II SSD: 18 seconds (2.6x faster)Windows Performance IndexHard Drive: 5.9Extreme II SSD: 7.8Launch Visual Studio 2010Hard Drive: 4.1 secondsExtreme II SSD: 1.6 seconds (2.6x faster)As you can see, operations become significantly faster with an SSD drive installed.  Applications open instantly with almost no delay.  Opening and saving files is almost instantaneous as well.  Just on the apps I measured, performance was between 2 and 4 times faster than what I got before upgrading to this SSD drive.INSTALLATION-----------------------------The SanDisk Extreme II is a perfect replacement for an existing 2.5\" laptop SATA hard drive.  I did a system restore backup of my old hard drive and then removed it and installed the SanDisk.  I then installed Windows 7 onto the SSD and ran the Windows system restore using the backup I had just created.  This process took about 90 minutes.  Once complete, I powered on the laptop and it booted up as if nothing had happened.Note: If you use Microsoft\\'s BitLocker encryption technology, make sure to either decrypt your hard drive before doing this process, or simply pause BitLocker encryption before removing your old drive and resume it after installing your new drive.SUMMARY-----------------------------The great thing about a technology like solid state drives (SSDs) is that they are completely transparent to your normal computer usage.  You don\\'t have to change the way you do things; everything works exactly like it did before, only much faster.  I will never own another laptop with a hard drive.  I will only own SSD drives going forward.

      "{'text': 'Great on Windows 7, pretty good on MacOS 10.6\\n--------- Windows 7 ---------I plugged in the USB receiver and within a minute Windows 7 had everything squared away and working.  Even extended keys such as the volume control worked with my HP nw8440 laptop.  From there, both the keyboard and mouse operated without fault.--------- MacOS 10.6 ---------I plugged in the USB receiver and within seconds the 2009 MacBook Pro recognized the mouse and keyboard.  It did ask me to tell it what kind of keyboard I had plugged in (US102) but humorously, the keyboard was already working while it asked me this question.Because this is a Windows-centric keyboard, the location of the \"Command\" functionality is poorly placed and not labeled.  I had to take a guess to figure out which button served as \"command\".  Due to the imperfect location, I consistently hit the wrong key (alt) when I was trying to do keyboard operators like cut-n-paste.  I will probably get used to this in time but for now it\\'s an annoyance.I was surprised to see that the mute/volume control keys worked fine with the MacBook.  Most of the auxiliary keys did not work.  Keys like F1-F12 seemed to do nothing except make the Mac beep at me.  The Aero Flip3D key which allows you to change windows easily on Windows 7 did nothing on the Mac.  This may have improved if I installed the included Intellitype CD which includes MacOS drivers.  I chose not to do this.Doing normal typing/navigation, the keyboard and mouse operated without fault on the Mac.--------- Overall ---------* The mouse seems able to track perfectly on any surface.  It\\'s quite impressive.  Short of dipping it in a bucket of water, I was not able to find a surface that the mouse couldn\\'t handle.* The mouse has a special holder for the small USB receiver that plugs into the computer.  When the USB key is plugged into the mouse, it disables the mouse LED and presumably conserves power.* The range is impressive.  My wife took the mouse 20 feet away and it never skipped a movement.  The keyboard also worked from about 20 feet away however when I took it into a separate room (30+ feet with closed door) it stopped working.* The keyboard input was pefect no matter how fast I typed.  I did not try playing any keyboard-intensive games.* The mouse vertical scroll feature (roller wheel) was jerky on both Mac and Windows.  The horizontal scroll feature on the mouse is so clumsy to be a gimmick.  I would never use the horizontal scroll button on this thing!* I haven\\'t used it long enough to test battery life.  I think the key is to see how well it handles \"standby\" operation.  I\\'ll update this review once I have a better idea of battery life.* The USB receiver gets surprisingly warm.  It\\'s not hot to the touch but it does get warm.* On both Windows and MacOS, subsequent usage of the USB receiver resulted in immediate visibility of the keyboard and the mouse to the operating system-- there was no recurring prompting/setup.* In the past I\\'ve only used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards so to me, the slight curve of the keys on this unit was comfortable and pleasant.* They keys are a bit squishy and don\\'t have the same tactile experience of other Microsoft keyboards that I use.  I\\'m not sure if I like this keyboard better or worse...it will take time to figure that out.I will give this 5 stars for Windows and 4 stars for MacOS.

      "{'text': 'Great GPS with big beautiful screen\\nI briefly owned a Nuvi 3490LMT and found it to be a great GPS.  Shortly after I purchased the 3490LMT this 5\" model was announced.  I returned the 3490LMT and ordered the 3590LMT that very day.  I am pleased to report that the Nuvi 3590LMT is also a great GPS navigator.PROs---------------------+ Screen is very easy to see, even in bright daylight+ Thin for a 5\" unit+ No issues with polarized sun-glasses+ Snappy user interface; every touch is immediately registered+ Drag gestures work on most screens+ Intuitive design, easy to use+ Removable window mount has a built-in speaker+ Map and software updates are easy; no registration required+ Very fast acquisition of GPS satellites+ Very fast routing and reroutingCONs---------------------- Pricey- The 5\" screen makes this too bulky to fit in your pocket or carry around (compromises!)- Windshield mount falls on occasionSCREEN---------------------The first thing I noticed about this GPS is the big bright screen.  From past experience, I knew that 5\" was the right size for me.  With a 5\" screen, I don\\'t have to focus as hard on the GPS when I take my eyes off the road.  This allows me to get my eyes back ON the road as fast as possible which makes the GPS safer for me.The screen on this unit is among best I\\'ve ever seen on a GPS (almost equal to the 3490LMT) and is clearly visible in the bright Texas sun.  Even my polarized sun glasses do not interfere with the screen.  The screen is really something to behold and is clearly where a lot of the cost of this unit stems from.  The reason I say this display is not quite equal to the 3490LMT is because it has the same pixel count but spread over a larger surface.  This means the display is not quite as crisp as the 3490LMT.  But you\\'ll have to look really really hard to notice the difference!The unit has an auto-night feature that reacts quickly to changing light conditions so that the GPS is never too bright when driving at night or in a dark area.The LCD viewing angle seems decent.  There is definitely some darkening of the display as you move off to the side.  For the primary viewer (the driver), the display will be easy to see even as you move your head around.  The passenger may have difficulty viewing what\\'s on screen if the unit is pointed at the driver.Much less important but still nice is how crisp the screen is.  It is a high resolution screen that renders maps faithfully with great detail, even when held close to your face.  This makes everything smooth and pretty.  Again, this is of questionable value when mounted in your windshield but it does look really nice.TRAFFIC---------------------I haven\\'t had much time to test the included HD traffic feature.  It seems like traffic information is only given to you if you\\'re driving on a route.  It would be nice if it actually showed you traffic in the area, even if you\\'re just driving without any route set.  Surely it could at least figure out that I\\'d be interested in traffic information on the very road I\\'m driving on!  After I\\'ve had more time with the unit I\\'ll update my review with more information on the traffic feature.From my experience with the 3490LMT, I expect it will tell me when traffic is ahead on a selected route.  One thing I wished the 3490LMT would do was tell me about traffic on the road ahead, even if it doesn\\'t know my destination.  It does not do that (though neither does the competition as best I can tell).NAVIGATION---------------------I love how quickly this unit acquires my location from the satellites.  Within a few seconds after turning on, it knows where I am.  My old TomTom often didn\\'t know where I was until I was well outside of my neighborhood.As with every other GPS I\\'ve ever owned, the default navigation view shows the current speed limits.  The bad news is the speed limits are sometimes wrong by 5 to 10mph.  This seems to be more common in neighborhoods and on lesser traveled roads but I\\'ve also encountered this on major freeways.  The good news is that you can tap on any bad speed limit shown on screen and a \"+/-\" button shows up that quickly lets you edit the speed limit.  I found myself doing this often after first but eventually the streets I drive most often were all corrected.  I wish they could get this stuff right without me making changes but it seems to be a universal problem.A nice visual cue to help you see your route is that after each turn, the graphical display zooms out to show you more of the upcoming route.  After a few seconds, it zooms back in to the previous zoom level.  This is subtle but effective in helping you see the details of your route while getting an occasional glimpse of the big picture.Something that I really like is that you can drag the map around with your finger while navigating: just like you would do in Google Maps on your cell phone.  This gives you the opportunity to see what else is around while sitting at a traffic light.Routing and rerouting has been very fast in my experience.  If I miss a turn, the GPS usually has the new route figured out in just a few seconds.  Much appreciated during those high anxiety goof-ups I sometimes make!Another nifty feature is that the 3590LMT learns your habits.  If you prefer a particular route home because you know more than the GPS, eventually it starts routing you via the route automatically.VOICE COMMAND---------------------In my experience, the voice command feature is so-so.  It hasn\\'t yet been able to find an address for me but it does seem to work pretty well when navigating to my saved shortcuts.  I say the command \"voice command, go home\" and it works fine every time.  This could get better with firmware updates.  It does seem to be important to be in a quiet environment (radio turned off, windows rolled up) when issuing voice commands.  No surprise there.  This feature may improve with firmware updates.MISCELLANEOUS---------------------The Garmin update software is very easy to use and works fine.  I was pleased that I didn\\'t have to create an account or register with Garmin.  I just plugged in my navigator and it downloaded the latest maps and firmware.Bluetooth works well with my iPhone 5.  The sound quality and volume isn\\'t stellar, but people can hear me and I can hear them and it always works, so I am pleased.So far the firmware has proven reliable.  I\\'ve never had it crash or hang on me.The mount to my windshield is fairly secure and stable.  It seems quite well made and the screen never sags under its own weight.  Unfortunately, the mount has fallen from my windshield twice in 3 months of usage.  Nothing has been damaged in the falls, but I find this annoying.  This caused me to drop this to a 4-star review.This unit seems to be a couple of millimeters thicker than the ultra-thin 3490LMT.  I\\'m not complaining about this, but I do wish it was as thing as the smaller unit.  Still, it\\'s not thick at all: barely thicker than my iPhone 4.SUMMARY---------------------So far this GPS is shaping up as the best I\\'ve ever used.  I\\'m very happy with this purchase.  I will continue to update my review as I spend more time with the unit.UPDATE---------------------About 6 months after purchase, the GPS stopped working right in the middle of a 2000 mile road trip.  The touchscreen became inoperable and the unit would crash after a few minutes of use.  Of course, this was highly frustrating.  Garmin support was easy to deal with.  Garmin immediately sent me an RMA form and after I sent it back to them, they sent me a brand new 3590LMT.  All told, this cost me just under $20 in shipping and a few weeks without the GPS.  Probably about as best as one can hope for in such a situation.  Hopefully the replacement will last longer!UPDATE 2---------------------A year after my original unit was replaced under warranty, the replacement unit is still going strong.

      "{'text': 'it\\'s gotten a lot better with updates\\nI received the Boxee Box immediately after its release in 2010 and, after testing, wrote a scathing 1-star review.  Since that time, the Boxee Box has received several firmware updates.  As of July 2011, I no longer feel the Boxee Box merits 1-star and am thus reworking this review.  Consider this review up-to-date as of July 2011.Let me begin by stating that I am new to the Boxee platform.  I\\'ve occasionally watched a missed episode of network TV on my MacBook attached to my TV; but only as a last resort.  I probably visit youtube.com about 4 times per year and never for more than a 10 minute period.  I pay for DirecTV and Sirius XM and have 4 networked DVRs.  In short, aside from the fact that I\\'ve been hacking computers since the early 80s, I am apparently not part of the target demographic for this product.General observations:- The box is nearly silent.  This is a very good thing.- The box is very small (about the size of a box that a baseball would come packaged in).- The box consume 12 watts of power while running, while idle, and while on standby.  If you turn it all the way off, it consumes 0 watts.  It seems to run just over 100 degrees while powered on.- While the unit itself is small, the mini power brick in the power plug is larger than typical-sneaky and annoying.REMOTE CONTROLThe remote control gets (some) raves and is probably one of the coolest things about this device.  It is also the main hardware component of the solution that makes the Boxee Box a hassle.  The remote control is RF which means it cannot control most devices in your house.  And likewise, your other remotes can\\'t control the Boxee box unless you add an IR adapter.  Forget about hitting one button to turn on the Boxee Box and your TV.  This is a major source of frustration for me as the Boxee Box remote is essentially 3 buttons and a 4-way navigation tool.  Because the button layout is perfectly symmetric, and the buttons are black, I frequently hold it upside down and hit the wrong buttons.  This is annoying and often disruptive to what I\\'m watching/listening to as I will accidentally exit the pandora or viewer apps!  I\\'ve had the Boxee for over 8-months now and this still frustrates me every time I use it.What is cool about the remote control is that when you flip it over, it has a decent sized keyboard!  When using the search features, this keyboard works like a charm.In practice though, my usage doesn\\'t result in much data entry so I don\\'t get the payoff of the keyboard.  Unfortunately, I DO prize being able to reliably pause/fast forward/rewind the Boxee Box remote control is not too good.  This can\\'t be fixed with firmware...I did find one way to improve upon the remote situation- I plugged in a wireless mouse and keyboard.  The wireless mouse made navigating the Boxee Box menus noticeably easier.Unfortunately, the mouse does not work for jumping to a spot in a song or a video.  Also, when surfing the web on the Boxee Box, the wireless mouse is unable to scroll content up and down and the roller wheel is completely disabled.INTERNET VIDEOThe video quality of some of the Internet content is surprisingly good.  Generally speaking, if you\\'re paying for the content, it will look as good as the best high def feed from your cable/satellite provider.  And generally speaking, if you get content for free, it can be pretty bad.The Wired application has a bunch of movie trailers and I honestly couldn\\'t tell that I was watching \"downloaded\" content.  The picture quality rivaled the HD quality I get over the air from DirecTV.  I found this impressive.  I have a 6Mb/s internet connection which is certainly not a slouch so I\\'m sure that helps.  Video quality can vary greatly though.  Some of the stuff on youtube borders on unwatchable (though that is the nature of youtube, not Boxee Box).My wife and I tried to watch an episode of CSI Miami on the Boxee Box and eventually gave up.  It wasn\\'t because CSI Miami is pointless and stupid, it was because the experience of trying to pause or navigate through the program was too awkward.  At one point I tried to pause the show but accidentally hit the \"menu\" button.  This took us out of the show and lost our spot.  Then we tried to relaunch it and fast forward to our old location.  This proved fruitless with the Boxee Box remote control.During the 2010-2011 Women\\'s basketball season, I ended up watching quite a few games on the Boxee Box as the only way to get them was on the Internet.  I had to be careful not to touch anything once I got the game on screen but generally speaking this worked well and I enjoyed it over watching the same content on my laptop.I am a Netflix streaming customer and the Boxee Box has a Netflix application.  The application works well.  Playback is first rate with excellent video and sound.  The remote control rears it\\'s ugly head here as the Netflix app does not obey the Boxee Box\\'s pause button.  This is supremely annoying.  I can\\'t pause Netflix without experimenting (sorry, I don\\'t remember the button press).Considering how well the Netflix application works on other platforms, I\\'m giving the Boxee Box implementation a \"C-\".  This can improve with updates.INTERNET MUSICThe Boxee Box Pandora application works great.  I was able to sync up to my Pandora account and play playlists of music that I like.  Pandora is a great product-- but it is hardly exclusive to the Boxee Box.  It takes a LOT less time to simply pick up my iPhone, launch the Pandora app and airplay to my AppleTV.LOCAL MUSICI have a large library of music that I\\'ve ripped into MP3 format on my mac.  I was able to share my music folder on the mac and Boxee immediately found it on the network- it wasn\\'t easy enough that my wife could figure out how to do it but I had no problem.  But things fell apart when I tried to actually listen to my music.  The problem is that Boxee can\\'t see your itunes playlists.  So you\\'re left with playing music one directory at a time.  This kills this feature for me- my directory structure is broken down by artist and then album.  I rarely want to listen to just one album at a time.  Because I didn\\'t layout my music according to genre, etc..., I have no easy way to listen to songs.I know nobody loves Apple, but implementing a way to import iTunes play lists would be helpful.LOCAL VIDEOI have a UPnP storage device on my network and uploaded a bunch of ripped DVDs.  I also uploaded videos that I had downloaded from the Internet over the years- many in a wide variety of formats.  When it comes to playing about any video you can think of, the Boxee Box is an A+ performer.  It sees my UPNP server on the LAN and with a couple of clicks I\\'m in watching a movie.  It always remembers where you left off and generally works perfectly.  Fast forward, rewind, pause, everything!As a comparison, I tried to view UPNP content on my DirecTV DVR.  It was a terrible, teeth gnashing experience that ended with my DVR crashing and rebooting.  Again, kudos to Boxee Box on their execution of this feature.Granted, you have to do a lot of extra work to get your videos into a storage device on your LAN, but if you have such a video source, this is a great product for watching it on your TV.SOCIAL MEDIASorry, but I\\'m not getting the whole \"add social media to your TV\" thing.  Gimmick!We were able to sync the Boxee Box with my wife\\'s FaceBook accountn but we never could figure out how to see FaceBook alerts while watching content.  We\\'d hear sounds when notifications came through but there was no obvious way to get to them.  We were so gunshy about touching the remote and losing our spot in a show that we decided they weren\\'t worth it and just got out her iPhone/iPad to see what was new...OTHERWith no local storage, the Boxee Box is not useful if your network is down or the content sources are unavailable (PC turned off).  There is no way to save content to your Boxee for advanced buffering if you have a slow internet connection.  You can plug in a USB key or a powered USB drive so it\\'s not the end of the world.They seemed to have done a good job with the CPU and memory selection- the unit is very snappy and fluid.  I was pleased with this.STABILITYWith firmware updates, the Boxee Box has gotten fairly stable.  It doesn\\'t crash very often.  There are some quirky bugs.  For example, about once per week, all of my \"Favorites\" disappear.  This always annoys me but if I restart the Boxee Box, things come back.SUMMARYIf you\\'re going to only use Netflix or other common paid services, spend 1/3 as much and get an AppleTV.  If you\\'ve got a bunch of ripped music and don\\'t have Apple devices, get the Boxee Box.  If you\\'ve got a ton of ripped video, get the Boxee Box.Make sure you have a fast Internet connection (probably 3Mbps is the minimum I\\'d go with).  Also, if your Internet provider is implementing data caps, you might not want streaming products like the Boxee Box as they consume a lot of data with frequent usage.The ideal Boxee Box would tweak the remote so you could use it without having to look at it, and add a hard drive so it could be self contained.

      "{'text': 'Did not work with my MacBook Pro 5,4\\nI was excited to upgrade the OEM 250GB hard drive in my 15\" MacBook Pro (5,4 mid-2009).  I actually bought two of the WD6400BPVT so that I could also upgrade my brother\\'s brand new 13\" MacBook Pro (MC374LL/A, mid-2010).  I did a full time machine backup of my system (snow leopard 10.6.4) and then followed easy instructions to remove the 10 back-plate screws and remove the hard drive.  Installation was a breeze and literally took 5 minutes.15\" mid-2009------------I booted from my Snow Leopard system disk and ran the disk utilities to format the drive.  This went without a hitch so I went back to the main system disk menu and choose to restore my time machine backup.  It saw my external time machine backup and began the restore.  After about 5 minutes, it reported that the install was going to take 25 hours.  WHAT???  I\\'ve restored my system before and it\\'s only taken a few hours so I knew 25 wasn\\'t good.  I let it run for an hour and the restore time was now up to 40 hours.  Abort!I booted into Snow Leopard system disk again and once again formatted the drive with the disk utilities.  This time I tried a different USB cord to my time machine external backup drive.  Same result.I rebooted a third time, erased the disk again, and this time tried to do a clean snow leopard install.  The system reported that the disk was not big enough after about 5 minutes of installation.  The system then froze and I had to hold down the power button to reset it.At this point, I tried the second identical drive and got identical behavior!  I think I\\'m going to try the WD6400BEVT drive since it doesn\\'t have the 4K sector feature.  That shouldn\\'t be the problem but the BEVT drives have been out a lot longer so maybe that helps.BTW, I\\'m not sure it matters but my 15\" MacBook Pro has the EFI 1.7 firmware update.13\" mid-2010------------The hard drive installed without difficulty on my brother\\'s 13\" mid-2010 macbook pro.

      "{'text': 'neat wireless camera but a few issues\\nThe D-Link DCS-5020L is a very nice network-based audo-capable camera that could be perfect with a few software fixes.PROs-----------+ Small and light allows for easy placement+ Wireless operation works great+ Nightvision easily lights up a large room+ Very good video quality+ pan & tilt+ wide viewing angleCons------------ Network repeater feature didn\\'t work for me- Couldn\\'t view video from a Mac- iPhone app is very difficult to use for pan & tiltSETUP----------------------------There are several options for installing this camera onto your network.  The first, and easiest, is to plug it directly into your wired network.  For most people, that isn\\'t going to be an option.  Fortunately, it was pretty easy for me to set this up for wireless access.  If your home network supports WPS, all you have to do is press the WPS button on your wireless network access point and then press the WPS button on the D-Link.  If you don\\'t use WPS, you\\'ll have to temporarily connect the camera to your wired network in order to manually configure wireless.Once attached to your network, you run a helper application provided by D-Link to configure the camera.  The helper application will automatically detect the camera and show you the options.  If you haven\\'t already, the application lets you setup wifi access to the camera.  It also lets you give the camera a name.  Finally, it lets you register this camera with D-Link\\'s free cloud-based \"mydlink\".  By registering the camera with mydlink, you\\'re able to view the camera from an iPhone or iPad.The camera is very light and comes with a multi-hinged base that allows for any conceivable installation position.  It also comes with a very long power cord (~10 feet!).  If you need to install it upside down, there is an advanced setting to invert the video feed.PERFORMANCE----------------------------I found the camera to perform well in all lighting conditions, including complete darkness.  The camera automatically changes from day mode to night mode or you can manually override from the app.  The mydlink lite application is available for Apple iOS devices and works very well for viewing video.  Performance was excellent over my wireless network.  I never experienced any poor performance, even when the camera was on the far side of my house.  Audio and video was smooth and without interruption.Unfortunately, my first real complaint involves a crucial feature: the mydlink lite apps ability to move the camera\\'s pan and tilt motor.  The user interface is very broken and requires a careful set of 4 taps to make one incremental move.  If you tap too fast, the app changes from portrait to landscape.  It is infuriating to use.  My wife gave up completely on using this feature.  It is entirely possible (hopeful!) that D-Link will release an updated app in which they have fixed this serious defect.Thankfully, pan and tilt does work fine from the web-based camera viewer.  The motor is very quiet.  Unless you\\'re listening for it, you won\\'t hear it.  The range of motion is quite complete and you can look about anywhere you would expect.This camera includes a microphone and the audio performance is amazing.  It\\'s eerie how sensitive the microphone is.  It can pick up conversations on the far side of my fairly large house.  This is a great feature because if someone is in another room ransacking your house, you can still hear them even if they aren\\'t in view of the camera.  Very impressive feature.The web application (mydlink.com) worked great for me on my Windows 7 laptop.  Unfortunately, on my MacOS 10.8 laptop, it was never able to load the video.  I noticed others with this complaint.  This is another serious defect that will impact some buyers.  It is also something that can be fixed with software updates.Due to the two problems I encountered, I am giving this camera 3-stars.  If and when D-Link corrects these issues, I will raise my rating accordingly.', 'rating': 3, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['feature', 'great', 'This is a great feature because if someone is in another room ransacking your house', 1], ['camera', 'light', 'The camera is very light and comes with a multi-hinged base that allows for any conceivable installation position', 1], ['video', 'smooth', 'Audio and video was smooth and without interruption', 1], ['performance', 'poor', 'I never experienced any poor performance', 1], ['performance', 'amazing', 'This camera includes a microphone and the audio performance is amazing', 1]], 'item': 'B00CL8F98W'}\n",
      "{'text': 'Both units failed within 60 days\\nFINAL UPDATE, NOVEMBER 2013My installer (Car Toys) was kind enough to offer to give me store credit on the second faulty DNX890HD in exchange for purchasing a new Pioneer AVIC-Z150BH.  I had to spend a couple of hundred dollars on the installation, but I now am Kenwood-free.  In late October 2013, Kenwood re-released their 1.6.0 firmware with a new hardware checker that can detect the fault internal SD card that is leading to the GPS failures.  I ran this installer on my DNX890HD and it indeed reported that my unit had a hardware SD failure and required replacement.You really should avoid this product until they fix their problems.------------------------UPDATE, OCTOBER 201360 days later and the new unit is doing the same thing as the old one.  The maps disappear and the unit only shows you what direction your driving.  I\\'m putting in another ticket with Kenwood.  Clearly this isn\\'t just a one-time deal; I would avoid this product.------------------------UPDATE, JULY 2013I took the unit back to the installer and they agreed it was defective and installed a new one for me without hassle.  Hopefully the new unit will last longer!------------------------UPDATE, JULY 2013The head unit died today.  It will play audio but the nav system is completely inoperable.  I contacted Kenwood and they told me to take it back to the installer.  Oh boy.  Unless this gets resolved favorably and quickly, this product will be losing some stars!------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is hands down the best after market radio that I could find in my research.  The DHX890HD is great because of the following:+ great sound quality+ very easy to use+ awesome Garmin navigation+ big bright screen+ great sounding bluetooth+ tons of powerful features and a variety of inputsMy DNX890HD was professionally installed in my truck.  I wanted a double-din receiver with navigation.  Having used a lot of different NAV systems over the years, it was important to me that I get a system with Garmin NAV because I\\'ve found their software to be the easiest to use.  The Kenwood DNX890HD uses Garmin NAV so it was at the top of my list of head units to consider.The navigation capabilities are seamlessly integrated into all aspects of the head unit.  When you\\'re on a screen doing something with Pandora, you\\'ll still see a small banner along the bottom giving you directions about your next turn.  Likewise, when in the navigation screen, you\\'ll see a small banner along the bottom with details on the active audio function.  For example, you might see the name of the artist currently performing.  At any time you can tap that banner and jump into the source for that audio, whether it be SiriusXM, Pandora, your phone, or other.Bluetooth sounds great with my iPhone 5.  The installer put the microphone right behind my rear-view mirror.  Calls are crystal clear through the stereo speakers and people that I call say that I sound great.  Unfortunately, it does not always connect when I start up the car.  It seems that if my wife and I alternate driving the car, it doesn\\'t always switch over to each others phones.Pandora integration is very cool.  When I connect my iPhone 5 directly to the USB port, or connect over bluetooth and then launch the Pandora app on the head unit, the phone displays \"Kenwood Sync\" and then all of my Pandora controls are on the touch screen display of the Kenwood.  You can thumbs up or thumbs down a song, and also fast-forward.  You can even change channels.I keep a flash drive full of music plugged into the second USB port (in my glove compartment).  This gives me a thousand extra songs for those times I don\\'t feel like listening to satellite radio or Pandora.I had the installer hook this up to the steering wheel controls on my Cayenne and that works great too.  From the steering wheel I can do volume control, mute, change inputs, fast forward and rewind songs.  It was worth the small extra charge to have this set up.Reasons that this is not a 5-star product:1) Bluetooth does not always automatically connect to my phone.  I blame this on the head unit because my old head unit always connected to the phone.2) it takes an awfully long time to turn on: after turning on the car, I wait 20-30 seconds before any music starts playingEven despite the minor issues above (both may improve with firmware updates), this is a fantastic head unit that my wife and I love.  Kenwood has been quite active with firmware updates and I expect the product to get even better with those.This review was written with the 5/31/2013 firmware from Kenwood.

      "{'text': 'Good unless you use more than one HDMI input\\nIf your HDTV is in a location that is not well suited to HDMI cable connections from your cable box or DVD players, the Belkin ScreenCast AV4 may be a satisfactory wireless solution.  Although the product delivers wireless audio and video of excellent quality, it has some limitations and is not well suited for all situations.  Read on for details.PROs-----------+ Wireless video/audio quality appears to be equal to direct-HDMI connected video+ 40 foot video feed through my walls worked flawlessly+ No interference (that I could detect) with my wireless network+ Basic setup surprisingly easyCONs------------ Flaky behavior of remote control- Slow to change display input sourceSETUP-----------The ScreenCast AV4 was fairly simple to attach to my home theater.  The package includes two pieces of hardware; one attaches to your television and a power outlet, the other attaches to each of your AV devices and a second power outlet.  Once done, I powered on both of the Belkin boxes and within 2 minutes there was video on my TV.Because this was my first time to power on the ScreenCast AV, a setup menu appeared asking me to select my language.  After that it said it was preparing to help me setup my inputs with usable labels (i.e. \"Satellite\", \"Blu-Ray\", etc...).  Unfortunately, something went wrong with the ScreenCast AV at this point and that menu never appeared.  The included remote control, used to change inputs on the Belkin between your AV devices, quit working completely.  Fortunately, I powered one of the Belkin boxes off, then back on, and the remote control started working.Aside from the problem setting up my inputs on the Belkin, the fact that the audio and video automatically started working is quite nice.  I think that if Belkin can come up with a firmware update to fix the issues with the remote control, setup would be a major positive for this product.USAGE-----------Most operation of this device is transparent.  If you had a simple setup involving nothing more than a cable or satellite tuner box and your HDTV, you would never interact with the Belkin.  Everything would just work.Unfortunately, many of us have more than one device attached to our HDTV.  It\\'s common to have a DVD/Blu-Ray player or possibly a gaming system or Internet-attached device.  Each of these typically consume an HDMI input on your HDTV.  The Belkin ScreenCast AV4 takes care of this by providing 4 HDMI inputs.  The problem is that changing between those inputs is a chore.  The included remote control is very tiny and the selection of inputs was a clumsy and slow affair that caused immediate frustration.There is a noticeable lag between when you push a button on the remote control and the Belkin responds.  This gets old fast.  The process of changing input from my DVR to my Boxee Box easily takes 10 seconds.  I can\\'t imagine anyone being satisfied with this level of performance.After some period of time (hours?), the remote control quit working again.  The box was sending audio/video and I was able to watch TV, but I was unable to change the input.  Powering off the unit with the IR receiver (for the remote) and then powering it back on solved this problem.GENERAL-----------The ScreenCast AV4 only supports HDMI devices.  If you have any older component video devices, they will not work.  If most of your equipment is newer than 2005, you probably don\\'t have this problem.  If you do have some older equipment you can\\'t use this product.With the ScreenCast AV4 attached to my Panasonic plasma television, the HDTV is no longer able to sense when a component attached to it has been turned off.  With direct HDMI connections, if I turned off my DVD player, Boxee Box, or DirecTV DVR, and somehow failed to turn off the Panasonic, it would automatically shut off about 2-3 minutes later.  Now it stays on forever showing only a black picture.  I don\\'t think this is a big problem but I do want to note it since I know some people probably have careless kids in the house that might not remember to turn off the TV.  If that is your situation, this device might cause premature wear on your TV and larger electricity bills.Combined power consumption of the two ScreenCast AV boxes was about 6 watts when idle (when your TV and cable box are off).  When you power on your TV and cable box, the combined power usage increased to about 11 watts.  That is a relatively low power consumption that you will not notice on your monthly bill.Neither unit has a fan; you will not hear any noise when they are turned on.SUMMARY-----------If you\\'re looking for a wireless connection to your HDTV and only have to deal with one audio/video source, the Belkin ScreenCast AV 4 is probably a very good choice.  The non-intrusive design, great audio/video performance, and very easy setup are great features.  For such a user, I\\'d give this product 5 stars.If you have a more complicated audio/video setup involving multiple devices, I\\'d probably see if there is something else out there that is better at handling changing of inputs.  For such a user, I\\'d give this product 3 stars.', 'rating': 4, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['power consumption', 'low', 'That is a relatively low power consumption that you will not notice on your monthly bill', 1], ['receiver', 'remote', 'Powering off the unit with the IR receiver (for the remote) and then powering it back on solved this problem', 1], ['video', 'audio', 'the fact that the audio and video automatically started working is quite nice', 1], ['product', 'excellent', 'Although the product delivers wireless audio and video of excellent quality', 1], ['equipment', 'new', 'If most of your equipment is newer than 2005', 1], ['setup', 'simple', 'If you had a simple setup involving nothing more than a cable or satellite tuner box and your HDTV', 1], ['audio', 'great', 'great audio/video performance', 1]], 'item': 'B005NYPC1U'}\n",
      "{'text': 'the best Sony yet\\nThe Sony SA-NS410 is an impressive sounding AirPlay speaker with good looks and a small footprint that allows for easy placement.  I\\'ve used other Sony wireless speakers and due to the size, sound quality, and features of the NS410, it is the best.PROs-------------+ Crystal clear sound, great acoustics.+ Small footprint.+ Very easy to setup.+ Has \"network standby\" so it always shows up in your airplay list.CONs-------------- Small external power brick complicates placement.SETUP-------------The SA-NS410 is very easy to setup.  Using the \"WPS\" sync button on the device, I had it synced with my secure wireless network in less than a minute.  It was a simple matter of pressing the \"WPS\" button on my wifi hotspot (most have them nowadays) and then pressing the \"WPS\" button on the speaker.  The rest is automatic.  For those that don\\'t have wireless, the speaker has an Ethernet port on the back that you can plug in with a standard cable.  Once connected to your network, the speaker immediately appears in the AirPlay list on any Apple products that you have.  I tested it from my iPad 3 and iPhone 5 and it showed up fine on both.I don\\'t think there is anything Sony could do to make setup easier and I don\\'t think the easy setup is an accident.  Sony apparently put a lot of effort into a great out-of-box experience and that effort pays off for the buyer.SOUND-------------This speaker replaced a far less expensive ($100) speaker and the step up in sound quality is profound.  I like that I can turn this speaker all the way to its loudest setting without any type of distortion.  At that volume it is painfully loud but crystal clear.  With placement in a corner (the shape lends itself well to corner placement), the bass is appropriately loud and tight.  The speaker is large enough (just over a foot tall) that it has a sizable driver and you can definitely feel the bass at high volumes.When you pick the speaker up, you\\'ll know right away it has a good driver as this thing weighs a lot.I\\'m very pleased with the sound quality and if I were going to buy another speaker for another room, the Sony SA-NS410 would be at the absolute top of the list.  For the price, the sound is probably unmatched.MISCELLANEOUS-------------The speaker comes with a small remote.  I\\'m not a big fan of these miniature remotes but it did have a neat feature: a dimmer button.  Since the speaker has a small LED that lights up when in use, I appreciated that I could dim that LED if I didn\\'t want it to light up my whole room.Besides the sound quality, the killer feature for me is the \"network standby\" mode that Sony included.  I\\'ve used other Sony AirPlay speakers and complained loudly about the way they disappeared off of my network after 30 minutes of idle.  This speaker NEVER disappears off of your network.  Even when powered off, you can see it in your list.This speaker has an understated design and blends nicely into the background.  I uploaded a picture of the speaker located in my master bath.  I like the way it looks and fits into a corner.The speaker is able to automatically update its firmware.  When I first added it to my network, the \"update\" button lit-up.  I held down the button and it started blinking and disappeared from my network for about 5 minutes.  Then it powered back up and onto my network.  It was very easy and gives me peace of mind that Sony is improving their products even after we buy them.  You never have to \"check\" for an update, it will tell you by way of the button when it detects an update.', 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['speakers', 'due', \"I've used other Sony wireless speakers and due to the size\", 1], ['sound', 'clear', 'PROs-------------+ Crystal clear sound', 1], ['bass', 'high', 'The speaker is large enough (just over a foot tall) that it has a sizable driver and you can definitely feel the bass at high volumes', 1], ['setup', 'easy', 'SETUP-------------The SA-NS410 is very easy to setup', 1], ['setup', 'easy', '+ Very easy to setup', 1], ['setup', 'easier', \"I don't think there is anything Sony could do to make setup easier and I don't think the easy setup is an accident\", 1], ['speaker', 'large', 'The speaker is large enough (just over a foot tall) that it has a sizable driver and you can definitely feel the bass at high volumes', 1], ['speaker', 'located', 'I uploaded a picture of the speaker located in my master bath', 1], ['feature', 'neat', \"I'm not a big fan of these miniature remotes but it did have a neat feature\", -1]], 'item': 'B006U1YULS'}\n",
      "{'text': 'Powerful but intuitive.  Control-freak\\'s dream!\\nBelow is my review of the Lorex LH118501 in an outdoor residential setting.  See my updates at the bottom.PROs+ Build quality seems excellent+ Feature set is powerful and extremely flexible+ Cameras work great, even in complete darkness+ DVR features are easy to use and intuitive+ Included monitor is small & very thin and perfect for surveillance+ Low power consumption+ Mobile access let you view cameras on your smart phone from anywhere in the world.+ Web access let you view your cameras, configure your system, and view recordings from anywhere in the world.+ Ability to receive e-mail alerts for configured alarm conditions.CONs- Depending on your ability and house, may require a professional installer.- Cameras have a relatively narrow field of view (50 degrees)- The lorexddns feature (which allows easy remote viewing) quit working after my router IP address changedINSTALLATIONI performed the installation of this product in my two-story house.  I used BNC to Type-F adapters and connected to the cameras through the cable lines in my house\\'s walls.  I think that is what most professional installations will do.  My house was built with RG6 coax cable runs to the front door and other areas of importance and I used those cables to send the camera signals back to my DVR.  If you do not have such coax cabling already in your walls, you may need a professional installer.  This is especially true if you do not have a one-story house with ready access to your attic.Installation of three cameras was straightforward but time consuming.  I began by surveying the different connector types and adapters that I would require.  I then purchased these online and waited until the next weekend to do the installation.  The day of the installation I spent approximately 8 hours climbing up and down ladders to get everything just the way I wanted it.  I\\'m quite pleased with the final result but if you are not patient or mildly handy, or if you are trying to reach high places or don\\'t have coax wiring already routed to your desired camera locations, you\\'re probably going to need a professional installation.I found the BNC connectors that attach the camera to the DVR to be very sturdy and it does not appear that you would have to worry about anything shaking loose.  I would have preferred \"Type F\" connectors (the kind you screw onto your cable box) since they are much more common in the US.The included 60\\' cable (per camera) thoughtfully includes a power run.  The cable is surprisingly thin- about the size as a USB cable.  This is great for letting you \"hide\" the cable under the edge of some carpet.  In my case, I did not use these cables since I had the RG6 already in the walls.USABILITYThe Lorex LH118501 has an intuitive GUI that appears anytime you click your mouse or use the included IR remote.  From there, a series of very simple menus are available to configure things such as cameras, recording options, internet options, alarms & motion detection, etc...I found that experimental clicking around with the included mouse often resulted in delightful surprises.  I was repeatedly pleased with how the product worked.  When I wanted to zoom in on a particular camera view, I intuitively guessed that I could double-click on it and indeed it worked.  When I wanted to zoom in more, I tried right-clicking and sure enough, a \"zoom\" option appeared.  This is a well designed user interface that is easy to navigate and explore.  I cannot stress how important this is.  Many products fail to produce an easy but powerful user interface.  This product was designed by someone that understands how to make a product easy to use without dumbing it down and taking away features.  I applaud their software development team.Another example of the fine usability is the prevalent \"copy to\" functionality.  On almost any screen, there is an ability to take the settings for that one camera, and \"copy to\" to another camera\\'s setting.  This allows you to quickly configure all 8 cameras with various settings that are right for your environment.  This is a thoughtful inclusion and much appreciated.FEATURESThe Lorex LH118501 is packed with all the features you could possibly want for a home security system.  The first thing that I did was setup each of my cameras to only record when motion is detected.  Technically, the DVR is always recording.  But the magic of the motion detection feature is that the DVR will only save recordings that are triggered by motion.  When motion occurs, the DVR rewinds back in time so you can see what happened just before the motion was detected and then it continues saving the recording for a configurable amount of time.  This is important because if you leave all cameras recording all the time, you have WAY too much video to sort through when you want to go back and look at something.  In my case, I want my camera at the front door to only save recordings when something interesting is happening.  This feature lets me do that.  Even cooler is that once you\\'ve setup a camera for motion detection, you can even configure what regions in the camera\\'s field of view will actually trigger the motion sensor.  For example, the camera above my front door is aimed to view my porch, front walkway, and the street.  While I want the street in the picture, I don\\'t want cars driving by to trigger the motion sensor.  An extremely simple grid tool lets me tell the Lorex only to detect motion on my walkway and porch.  The end result is that if someone walks up to the house I\\'ll get a recording and be able to see their car but I won\\'t have to sort through hundreds of recordings of cars driving by to find this one event.  Very cool.While the motion sensing feature sounds good on paper, it actually works quite poorly in an outdoor area.  I have four outdoor cameras and end up with at least 100 \"false recordings\" per day.  Things like the sun blowing leaves on trees (reflecting as shadows on the ground) or even an occasional insect flying by the camera trigger false positives.  I think this feature is probably really only of use for indoor situations where mother nature doesn\\'t interfere.All cameras can be setup with schedules of operation.  If you don\\'t want a camera recording during some part of the day or night, you can configure that.  If you consider motion in your living room an \"alarm\"  from 8-5 but not otherwise, you can configure that.MONITORThe included 13\" LED monitor is light and very thin (an inch or less).  It will be easy to mount just about anywhere and with minimal support.  The picture provided is clear and crisp.  Because it is an LCD, it won\\'t suffer burn-in.  And because it is LED-based, it uses minimal power and doesn\\'t generate any heat.  I was impressed with this monitor- it is very nice and not at all an afterthought.The monitor will let you view 8 cameras, 4 cameras, or 1 camera at a time.  If configured, motion sensor feature will let any camera that is detecting motion automatically take over the full screen view.  There is also a very handy \"picture in picture\" function that will let you view one camera full screen (say the cash register) while having a tiny floating window show you another camera.  The PIP window can be dragged anywhere on the screen so you can put it anywhere that doesn\\'t obstruct what you\\'re trying to see on the main view.CAMERASThe DVR can handle 8 cameras but this bundle comes with 4.  The cameras are lightweight but appear to be well engineered and constructed.  Each camera requires a video connection and low-voltage DC power connection.  The mounting bracket is made of a lightweight metal and can articulate about any direction you can imagine.  It should be easy for you to point a camera in any desired direction from any mounting surface.  The cameras are very small and not at all intrusive.The cameras automatically sense ambient light levels and have three modes of operation.  In bright lighting, the cameras capture a full color image.  If light is a little too dim, the cameras switch to black & white mode to give better clarity.  Finally, in darkness, a set of infrared LEDs automatically turn on for a full night-vision.  I haven\\'t experimented with the reach of the night vision but it does work extremely well in my limited testing.  This is a great security feature.I\\'m pleased the report that the cameras are reasonably robust.  During the installation I accidentally dropped one of the cameras from a height of about 8 feet.  It fell onto a grassy area and took a nice bounce but was fine.  Whew!One thing I don\\'t like about the cameras are their somewhat limited field of view.  At 50 degrees, they are only able to view just over half of a room.  Realistically, if you want full coverage of a room, you\\'ll need two cameras.  Some of the other Lorex cameras offer a 70 degree field of view which seems like it would be more useful overall.WEB ACCESSSetting up web access to my Lorex LH110 proved very easy.  All I had to do was connect the box to my Ethernet network and then write down the IP address it was given.  I was then able to use my Windows 7 laptop (on the same network, in my house) to connect and see all of the cameras.  Once the November 2011 firmware update came out, I was also able to view the Lorex web access from my Macintosh as well.  The Macintosh GUI is every bit as nice as the Windows version; that made me happy.  The web access would not work under Firefox on Windows.In summary, the web application now (as of November 2011) works fine with Internet Explorer 9 and Safari. It does a fine job of displaying what is showing on my four cameras.  I am able to zoom into each camera as if I was using the DVR console.IPHONE ACCESSFollowing the provided instructions I was able to install the Lorex Mobile ECO application from the Apple App Store.  It was a free download.  Once running, I gave it the IP address and password to my DVR and was able to quickly see the camera views.  It worked very well and was quite a novelty.  I find myself using this feature almost daily.  I check on my dogs and also check for packages on my front door.  I love this feature of the product.One feature that they do not yet have in their iPhone app is the ability to view past recordings.  I would very much value the ability to run a report of all \"motion alarms\" and then view that video from my phone.  You can run reports from the web browser.REMOTE VIEWINGLorex includes a free \"DDNS\" service with this product.  Without going into technical details, this is a technique for giving you a free internet \"name\" that you can use to access your home security system from anywhere on the planet.  [...]  And then from either your iPhone Lorex app or from any Internet Explorer web browser, you can [...] log in and see your cameras.The procedure for setting up DDNS was easy and straightforward.  The only thing that might trip some people up is setting up \"port forwarding\" on your home firewall.  Lorex has instructions on how to do that and they also have a tool on a CDROM that will do it for you.  Since I have advanced knowledge in this area, I did not use their tool.Once I set it up, I initially found that it works as advertised and I had no problems remotely viewing my cameras.  It\\'s a really powerful feature.  I showed the live camera feed to some friends at work and they were all impressed and interested.  Unfortunately, after my DSL company replaced my router, it picked up a new public IP address but the lorexddns.net never updated as it should have.  It\\'s stuck with my old IP address.  This means it no longer works.  I am still able to remotely view my cameras but I had to manually look up my public IP address and write it down.  DDNS should have allowed me to avoid that.SUPPORTOnce DDNS quit working, I decided to look for an answer from Lorex.  Forget about it.  I couldn\\'t find anything useful on their website and I could not find any way to contact them.  They clearly don\\'t want you to bother them if you have problems.  If I do figure out how to contact them, I\\'ll update this part of my review.  I\\'m tempted to lower my review to 4 stars because of this but the product has been so reliable, it\\'s hard to punish the rating for this flaw.GENERALThe DVR box uses between 9 and 10 watts during operation.  This is consistent with other small appliances in my house such as my Apple TV and Boxee Box.  I think ~10 watts is a very respectable number for a product of this type.  For comparison, my directv DVR uses 50% more power at 15 watts.  All four cameras combined use a total of 1 watt of power.  This is an impressively low number.  I suspect the number goes up when in \"nightvision\" mode but I haven\\'t measured that.The system boots quickly after power outage (&lt; 1 minute) and the user interface is very snappy.  All operations that I performed while configuring the units occurred instantaneously.  Button clicks registered immediately.  This pleased me because so many products under-provision the computing power required for even basic interactions and result in a laggy/annoying experience (directv!!!).Buttons on the front of the DVR allow for basic configuration/control though I found that I most often reached for the included optical mouse.While the July 2011 firmware update completely erased all of my settings, subsequent updates have not suffered from this problem.  Since July 2011, I\\'ve never had any settings lost during firmware updates.FINAL THOUGHTSAside from the issues mentioned above, this product \"just works\".  I never have to mess with it or reboot it.  The Lorex is always working when I need it.  I\\'m impressed with the level of reliability and very happy with this product.', 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['lighting', 'bright', 'In bright lighting', 1], ['display', 'fine', 'It does a fine job of displaying what is showing on my four cameras', 1], ['inch', 'less', 'MONITORThe included 13\" LED monitor is light and very thin (an inch or less)', 1], ['features', 'easy', 'even in complete darkness+ DVR features are easy to use and intuitive+ Included monitor is small & very thin and perfect for surveillance+ Low power consumption+ Mobile access let you view cameras on your smart phone from anywhere in the world', 1], ['download', 'free', 'It was a free download', 1], ['quality', 'excellent', 'PROs+ Build quality seems excellent+ Feature set is powerful and extremely flexible+ Cameras work great', 1], ['feature', 'sound', 'While the motion sensing feature sounds good on paper', 1], ['feature', 'great', 'This is a great security feature', 1], ['cameras', 'automatic', 'The cameras automatically sense ambient light levels and have three modes of operation', 1], ['cameras', 'lightweight', 'The cameras are lightweight but appear to be well engineered and constructed', 1], ['camera', 'full', 'There is also a very handy \"picture in picture\" function that will let you view one camera full screen (say the cash register) while having a tiny floating window show you another camera', 1], ['camera', 'live', 'I showed the live camera feed to some friends at work and they were all impressed and interested', 1]], 'item': 'B004ZKH1NA'}\n",
      "{'text': \"great performer\\nThe Lexar JumpDrive P10 is a 32GB USB flash drive with capacity and performance that makes it well suited for carrying around large files.  I use this Lexar to move virtual machine images between different systems when I don't have the luxury of setting up a direct file transfer over the network.The main reason to spend this much money on a USB thumb drive is to get USB3 support as well as the fastest NAND flash circuitry.  When connected to a system with USB3 support (blue USB port), the Lexar is the fastest flash drive in my possession.  I compared the Lexar to my 32GB Patriot Rage XT (also a USB3 drive).  In my testing, the Lexar is noticeably faster at writing files and about the same at reading files.Using Windows 7 professional on a laptop with an SSD drive and a USB3 interface, I was able to transfer a 13.8GB virtual machine image in these times:Lexar (NTFS): Write(4:21), Read(2:18)Patriot (NTFS): Write(5:42), Read(2:27)I then moved both drives to a standard USB2 port on the same laptop and tested copying the file again:Lexar (NTFS): Write(11:30), Read(8:11)Patriot (NTFS): Write(11:45), Read(8:09)As you can see, if you don't have USB3 connections on your computer, there is no reason to pay this much for a flash drive.  With USB3, writes are about 25% faster than my already blazing fast Patriot Rage XT.  Reads are about 7% faster.Given that the 32GB Lexar currently costs close to double price of the 32GB Patriot Rage XT, it is probably hard to justify the cost unless you spend a lot of time transferring very large files onto USB drives.In my testing I noted that I formatted the drive as NTFS.  This is because out of the box, the Lexar drive comes formatted as FAT32.  While FAT32 is a lot more widely supported, the performance was noticeably worse until I reformatted the drive as NTFS.  If you have to use FAT32 for compatibility reasons, you may not get the performance that you expect out of this drive.Aside from performance, the drive has a metal shell which adds weight but also gives it a feeling of durability.  As with many USB flash drives, it is wide enough that it blocks access to the USB port adjacent to it on my laptop.  This can sometimes be a problem for me because one of my laptops (an old MacBook Pro) only has two USB ports.  Though this drive is the same thickness as my Patriot Rage XT, it is nearly half an inch longer; this flash drive is physically the largest drive that I own.\", 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['drive', 'fastest', 'the Lexar is the fastest flash drive in my possession', 1], ['port', 'standard', '27)I then moved both drives to a standard USB2 port on the same laptop and tested copying the file again', -1], ['laptops', 'old', 'This can sometimes be a problem for me because one of my laptops (an old MacBook Pro) only has two USB ports', -1], ['inch', 'longer', 'it is nearly half an inch longer', -1], ['transfer', 'large', 'it is probably hard to justify the cost unless you spend a lot of time transferring very large files onto USB drives', -1]], 'item': 'B00CG5EF5I'}\n",

You simply plug one of these into a power outlet near your home network and connect the very tiny \"receiver\" to your existing network.  You then plug the other of these near wherever you need up to four network ports.  It is that simple; within seconds, the two sides connect and you have a very reliable and high speed network connection.I used the Actiontec adapters to stream high definition movie content between DVRs and had no issues at all.  I also used it to stream highest quality Netflix HD movies and again, it worked flawlessly.What is beautiful about this is that it gives you a very high speed network connection using something that all of our homes already have: power outlets.The speed and range blows away what you can get with a wireless connection.  Even using 802.11n wireless (at this time the most prevalent high-speed wireless), I would get intermittent outages when trying to stream HD content in my house.  With the Actiontec Powerline Ethernet adapters, the network \"just works\".There are a few features that set this apart from other Powerline Ethernet setups that I\\'ve seen:1) the single-port outlet that you put near your existing home network is very tiny.  It barely covers the single outlet that it is using (all others I\\'ve seen are 2-3x larger).2) the other end of the connection has four outlets; great for installing behind your home entertainment system so you can hook up a smart TV, a blu-ray player, Xbox or a Playstation and whatever else you might have that could benefit from a fast/reliable network connection.3) After a power outage, it reconnects in just a couple of seconds.  Others I\\'ve used can take up to 30-40 seconds to link to your network after a power outage.I think this is a great product and the price is quite reasonable.', 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['quality', 'high', 'I also used it to stream highest quality Netflix HD movies and again', 1], ['speed', 'high', 'What is beautiful about this is that it gives you a very high speed network connection using something that all of our homes already have', 1], ['speed', 'high', 'the two sides connect and you have a very reliable and high speed network connection', 1], ['speed', 'reliable', 'the two sides connect and you have a very reliable and high speed network connection', 1], ['product', 'great', 'I think this is a great product and the price is quite reasonable', 1]], 'item': 'B00CB2F65O'}\n",

      "{'text': 'A quality, durable, versatile iPad case.\\nMAY 2012 UPDATEI upgraded to an iPad 3 and find this case works fine.  It is a tight squeeze getting the new iPad into the Ori but it does fit.  I was able to get all four corners snapped into the case.  I\\'m very happy to be able to use this with my new iPad!ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWSThe Joby Ori for the iPad 2 is a quality case with superior construction and excellent aesthetics.  The case appears to be built to last and provides genuine impact protection to all areas of the iPad 2.  In addition to providing protection, the case is quite versatile.  It is able to transform into several different positions that allow it to serve as a stable reading stand in either portrait or landscape modes.All of the outward facing construction is of attractive aluminum.  The aluminum provides great protection and looks while not adding much weight.  I appreciated the usage of a magnetic cover to integrate with the iPad 2 auto on/off feature.  When you flip open the Ori, your iPad 2 turns on automatically.  And likewise, when you close this case, your iPad 2 will turn off.The iPad snaps firmly into a plastic holder that appears to be almost identical to the holder used in other Joby products for the iPad 2 (I have a Joby Yogi).If you travel a lot, I think this is the ideal case for providing you with great protection but also some novel utility such as the ability to serve as a stand for your iPad 2.  If you don\\'t travel much and don\\'t need screen protection, I\\'d opt for the Joby Yogi.  The Yogi is considerably cheaper and infinitely flexible as an iPad 2 stand/holder.When my iPad 2 is in the Ori, I feel it is well protected.  When you have the case setup as a stand, it elevates the display 7-8 inches into the air.  My wife uses this feature to read from her iPad 2 while doing her hair in the morning.  The stand holds the iPad 2 so high that it is easier to read while she is standing.  All the while, it is still quite stable and not prone to tipping over.We only have minor complaints.  Once inserted into the plastic holder, it is sometimes quite difficult to remove the iPad 2 from the case.  It would be nice if there was a mechanical release mechanism.  Instead you have to tug on the iPad 2 until it \"snaps\" out.  We also find it a bit awkward twisting and turning all of the different joints on the Ori to get it setup the way you want.  I don\\'t think there is any way to fix this- it\\'s kind of the nature of being such a wonderfully flexible product.Overall we love this case and highly recommend it.', 'rating': 5, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['construction', 'excellent', 'ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWSThe Joby Ori for the iPad 2 is a quality case with superior construction and excellent aesthetics', 1], ['squeeze', 'tight', 'It is a tight squeeze getting the new iPad into the Ori but it does fit', -1]], 'item': 'B0050A1O5U'}\n",

      "{'text': 'Sound cuts out frequently\\nSony RDP-X200IPThis speaker offers quality sound in a small package.  The addition of Bluetooth audio gives you a lot of connectivity options.  Unfortunately, the speaker\\'s usability does not live up to the feature list.  Bluetooth connections frequently disconnect or lose audio.  Docked connections to my iPhone 4 are finicky and disconnect randomly even when nothing has moved.PROs+ Very good sound quality.+ Reasonably small.+ Bluetooth audio easy to setup.CONs- Large external power brick.- Muddy bass.- Bluetooth audio experiences frequent interruptions making it unusable.- The built-in dock connector is flaky and frequently disconnects from the phone.SETUPIf you are going to dock your Apple iPod/iPhone/iPad, setup is as simple as plugging it in.  I tested with an iPhone 4 with the Apple bumper installed and the connection was intermittent.  The phone would either not know that it was docked or audio would not play through the speaker.  With the iPhone bumper removed, things improved but are still flaky.  Even a slight adjustment of the iPhone can cause sound to disconnect and start playing directly from the iPhone.  Other dock connectors I\\'ve used have been better.  I consider this a major flaw in the product.Because I wanted to use Bluetooth, I followed the extremely simple instructions and had Bluetooth paired with my iPhone in about 60 seconds.  It is the same as pairing any other device- you go into the Bluetooth settings on your iPhone and then hold down the Bluetooth button on this unit for a few seconds.  Everything is automatic from there: pretty foolproof and much appreciated.SOUND QUALITYThis unit has good sound quality for its size.  Bass is the weak area.  It\\'s not that the unit doesn\\'t offer plenty of bass, but the bass can be muddy.  Still, sound is very good and I\\'m happy with it.Bluetooth audio quality seems quite good.  I couldn\\'t discern a difference between the sound quality over Bluetooth versus using the dock connector.  Range seems to be about 30 feet.  More than 30 feet and music from my iPhone 4 cuts in and out.Unfortunately, bluetooth audio connections always decline after some time and after 5-10 minutes of listening the setup is unusable as the music cuts out constantly.  This happens even if my phone is 1 foot from the speaker.  I know this could be an issue with my phone but I use bluetooth on my iPhone all the time and never have issues.  I think it is probably the speaker that is at fault.  I also notice that sometimes the speaker refuses to connect to my phone.  Given the dock connector is very flaky too, this makes the product mostly unusable for me.D-Sappli iOS APPI downloaded Sony\\'s free D-Sappli app from the Apple app store.  When my phone is docked, I can run this app and have my dock act like a semi-intelligent alarm clock.  You can setup a range of times for it to play (start time, end time, and list of songs).  You can also set it to perform a sleep function where it will play for 15+ minutes and then go silent.MISCELLANEOUSThe unit comes with a tiny remote minuscule remote that seems to work well.  It also comes with a large power brick (think \"laptop computer\") that made placement more difficult.  You can hide the brick behind the speaker so it\\'s not the worst thing in the world.  Still, I wish the power conversion was integrated to give a cleaner look.SUMMARYDue to the connectivity problems, I think you should look for a different speaker.

      "{'text': \"nice holster, DSLR + big lens fits comfortably\\nI have a big case that I use to tote around my D700 body and a couple of big lenses, but it is overkill for a lot of situations.  Often times I am going somewhere and have a particular lens in mind that I'll use for all of my shooting.  This holster is perfect for such occasions.Without even expanding the extra length, the Case Logic holster easily accommodates my D700 with 85mm F1.4 or 24-70 F2.8 lens.  There is even room for a couple of filters at the very bottom.The holster comes with a number of shallow pockets that can hold cleaning products or spare memory cards.The holster is very well padded and hugs my Nikon D700 and lens tightly.  I feel pretty confident that my camera would survive a moderate drop while stored in this case.The holster also comes with a rain sleeve that pulls over to cover all zippered surfaces.  It stores neatly in one of the pockets.  I don't think it will make things water proof, but it will give you some comfort if you end up toting this around in the rain.As noted in the product description, there is an expansion zipper that increase the length of the holster by several inches.  This gives more than enough room for a large 70-200mm lens.The holster has a simple hand grip along the top and comes with an adjustable strap.  The shoulder padding on the strap is of a very grippy material that doesn't slide off my shoulder when walking around: much appreciated.My only complaint, and the reason I gave this four stars, is that the top zipper (the one you use to access your camera) kinks up when going around a corner.  This sometimes makes it a chore to get out your camera.  If the kink gets better or worse with usage, I'll update my review.Every Case Logic product that I own has proven durable and, looking at this case, I think it will last a long time.

      "{'text': 'Very good quality, a bit on the unattractive side.\\nI picked up these headphones in hopes of consolidating existing headphones into one pair that could do everything.  I have an old Plantronics headset that I use with a 2.5 -> 3.5mm adapter that I use for work and when dialed into conference calls.  I also have a Sony MDR-V700 headset that I\\'ve used for years when listening to music or gaming.These headphones come in a shiny white that is terribly dorky looking once adorned.  Think 1960s science fiction or perhaps a Saturday Night Live skit.  The first time I put them on, my wife let out a cruel laugh.  If, after reading this review, you decide that you need the SiberiaV2, I strongly recommend you consider another color, probably black.MUSICI began by listening to the same song using both my Sony MDR-V700s and the SiberiaV2s.  The stated purpose of the SiberiaV2s is for gaming (\"professional gaming gear), and the documentation proclaims that they are \"specifically created for the sound profile used in the most popular eSports games today.\"  Still, if you\\'re going to drop $100 on a pair of headphones, I think it\\'s fair to say you\\'d like to be able to listen to music on them!The sound from the SiberiaV2s was noticeably crisper and brassier than my Sonys.  This was accompanied by less bass than I get with the Sonys.  I preferred the sound of the Sonys for music.  Obviously that is a personal choice and since the SiberiaV2 is supposed to be better for gaming sounds, I figured this was acceptable.I played around with the sound profiles on my iPhone and was able to use the \"bass enhancer\" setting to get these to sound like the Sonys.  Likewise, I tried a different sound profile with the Sonys and got them to sound just like the SiberiaV2s.  My Sonys are a pretty decent set of headphones that I spent over $150 on back in the late 90s so this tells me that the SiberiaV2s have some serious capabilities.GAMINGI brought up Epic\\'s nifty demo game (Epic Castle) on my iPhone and proceeded to try out both headsets.  The result was similar to listening to music- the SiberiaV2s had a crisper sound but less bass.  Overall, I think that the focus on higher sounds probably does make sense in gaming.  As neat as it is to hear the loud bass of an explosion, any serious gamer knows that all that bass is just covering up sounds that actually matter to your survival in the game.I think these will be good for serious gamers.  They worked fine in my laptop although I lost the microphone capability due to incompatibility with the plug on my laptop.  An inexpensive adapter would likely solve this problem.Of bigger concern with using the SiberiaV2 with anything but an iPhone is the relatively short length of the cord.  Don\\'t get me wrong, the 40\" cord is the perfect length for me to have plugged into my iPhone while it\\'s in my pocket or in my hand.  It is long enough that I have no motion restrictions and yet short enough that it is not hanging down and catching on things.  But if you wanted to plug these into a desktop PC, the cord is likely too short.  Still, I don\\'t think these are really made for desktop gaming and for my needs, the length of the cord is perfect.PHONE CALLSI didn\\'t have a way to test the microphone while gaming so I used the headset to make a few phone calls.  The sound quality is great and everybody that I spoke to said that I sound great.COMFORTI wore the SiberiaV2 for well over an hour earlier today.  They are actually quite comfortable and are truly \"over the ear\" in that the sound cup engulfs my entire ear.  This means that the pressure from the headphones is applied to the area around your ear.  This made the SiberiaV2 very comfortable for me.  Never did I get the painful feeling of squished cartilage like I get after a short time with my MDR-V700s.Something I noticed immediately about the SiberiaV2s is how light they are.  They have plastic construction and weigh considerably less than the much heavier Sonys.The headphones \"breathe\" pretty well but I did notice some perspiration around my ears after wearing them for an hour.  This is another area where my Sonys falls short- usually just 15 minutes in the Sonys have my ears wet with perspiration.  Overall, I think the SiberiaV2s breathe better and that I didn\\'t sweat as much while wearing them.A major comfort issue for me was that the SiberiaV2s squished down on the side of my glasses.  This proved quite uncomfortable and seems to be the tradeoff for the fact that they truly go over the ear.  I don\\'t have this problem with my Sonys.  With some adjusting of my glasses, I was able to make this less of a problem.PACKAGINGI usually don\\'t comment on the packaging of a product but this product came in an exceptionally nice package.  When you first pick up the package, your first thought is \"quality\".  The reason I mention this is that if you are giving these as a gift, you can be assured that the recipient will have a great first impression of their shiny new toy.SUMMARYThe SiberiaV2s have really good sound and the addition of a microphone makes them ideally suited for gaming.  With a little adjusting, I was able to make them quite comfortable and found that long-term usage was quite tolerable.  The over-the-ear design helps block out adjacent sounds while on the phone or in a game.  I think they are a bit overpriced at $100 but given the quality of the speakers and the inclusion of a microphone, it\\'s probably hard to find something as good for a lot less money.', 'rating': 4, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['headphones', 'decent', 'My Sonys are a pretty decent set of headphones that I spent over $150 on back in the late 90s so this tells me that the SiberiaV2s have some serious capabilities', 1], ['gaming', 'better', 'Obviously that is a personal choice and since the SiberiaV2 is supposed to be better for gaming sounds', 1], ['laptop', 'fine', 'They worked fine in my laptop although I lost the microphone capability due to incompatibility with the plug on my laptop', 1], ['quality', 'good', 'Very good quality', 1], ['sound quality', 'great', 'The sound quality is great and everybody that I spoke to said that I sound great', 1], ['sound', 'less', 'The result was similar to listening to music- the SiberiaV2s had a crisper sound but less bass', 1], ['sound', 'different', 'I tried a different sound profile with the Sonys and got them to sound just like the SiberiaV2s', 1], ['sound', 'real', 'SUMMARYThe SiberiaV2s have really good sound and the addition of a microphone makes them ideally suited for gaming', 1], ['sound', 'great', 'The sound quality is great and everybody that I spoke to said that I sound great', 1], ['bass', 'loud', 'As neat as it is to hear the loud bass of an explosion', -1]], 'item': 'B0056VOM2U'}\n",
      "{'text': 'Hands down my best lens\\nThis lens is the best lens I\\'ve had the privilege of using.  The images I\\'ve gotten so far have eye popping clarity with amazing low-light handling and magical bokeh.Years ago I spent a lot of time with a Canon 50mm F1.4.  I now use a Nikon D700 and shoot with my Nikon 24-70 F2.8g and this lens.  On a full frame camera such as the D700, this focal length is quite nice for getting great close-ups without being up in everyone\\'s face.  The depth separation shooting at F1.4 is much more dramatic than what you get with the 24-70 F2.8.I cross shopped this with the older 85mm F1.4D.  I even rented that lens and took 2000 shots with the F1.4D.  I found the older lens to be slow focusing and very loud.  It also suffered from fairly severe chromatic aberration (ghoulish purple fringe) in several shots I took.  It was these limitations that made me pay the extra money for the 1.4G.  I\\'m so glad I did.After a weekend of shooting, I sent a flickr link to a friend at work and he later stopped me in the halls and brought me to his desk to ask questions about some of the shots I had gotten.  He wanted to know how to get his shots to look like that.

      "{'text': 'great technical support\\nBefore I describe my experience using this remote, I want to share with you how great Logitech\\'s technical support is.  Out of the box, I had an issue connecting this remote to my wireless network.  I followed the simple instructions provided by Harmony but it never worked.  Eventually I gave up and called the Harmony support line.I spent three minutes on hold before being greeted by a very competent technical support agent.  She walked me through the steps I had already tried but then was able to help me perform additional steps that finally got my setup working.  She was very knowledgeable about the product and clearly understood how to troubleshoot the issue.  I spent a total of 20 minutes on the phone and when I hung up, everything was working perfectly.  It\\'s refreshing to deal with a  company that actually cares enough about their products to invest in well trained and helpful support personnel.On to the remote!I really like the Harmony Smart Control with simple remote.  The simple remote has a great feel in my hand and is textured on the back so that it won\\'t slip around.  It has the same buttons as the Harmony Ultimate remote, just no touch screen.  (I uploaded a picture of them side-by-side.)  To make up for the lack of a touch screen, the simple remote adds numbers buttons for changing channels and three mode buttons that allow you to control 6 different start up activities (3 via short-press, 3-via long press).  It operates on a disposable CR-style battery (included).Of course, the main feature of this product is not the classic-style simple remote described above, but rather the Harmony Smart Controller hub.  This hub serves several purposes.  First, it can sync your remote settings from the myharmony.com website.  The way it works is you log into myharmony.com, and then can view all of your Harmony remotes.  If you want to make changes (re-assign a button, add a delay after an action, add a new device), you make changes on the site.  When done you can go to the Harmony Control app on your smart phone and click \"sync\" and it will pull your settings off of the Internet and onto your smart control and simple remote.  It\\'s that simple and you never have to attach anything to your computer to be reprogrammed.The Smart Control hub also allows the free iPhone app to communicate with your home entertainment system as it converts the iPhone commands into IR commands that your home theater can understand.The iPhone app is quite responsive and lets you swipe your fingers to do things like increase volume, fast forward/rewind, or even tap the screen to alternate between playing and pausing.  You can also get to a variety of screens that let you access all the same buttons (and then some) that you can from the simple remote.  The app is every bit as fast as the IR remote and, unlike the included IR remote, you can actually see it in the dark.You can use either the included simple remote or your smartphone (or both) to control your home entertainment system.  For my money, I can\\'t get into the iPhone app because it requires the screen to be lit all the time (draining battery, shining in my face).  I find myself preferring the physical remote.As for the physical remote, my one complaint is that it is not back-lit and the buttons are not raised up enough to allow you to feel them in the dark.  In a dimly lit room it\\'s difficult to find the right button.  I ended up installing the Harmony Smart Control in a room where I mostly do daytime viewing so this isn\\'t a major problem.  But if I was going to use this in my main TV room, it would annoy me somewhat.So far I\\'m very pleased with the performance of this remote and think it is a great way to get an extremely simple-to-setup remote that is powerful enough to control almost any setup you throw at it.', 'rating': 4, 'user': 'A2OS3TIVAKUAHG', 'sentence': [['feature', 'main', 'the main feature of this product is not the classic-style simple remote described above', 1], ['device', 'new', 'add a new device)', 1], ['tech', 'great', 'great technical support', 1], ['buttons', 'same', 'It has the same buttons as the Harmony Ultimate remote', 1]], 'item': 'B00BQ5RYI4'}\n",

In fact, I have one hanging from each of my HD TVs \"just in case\" I ever need to hook up my Mac laptop.This adapter has a special advantage over the old ones: if you have a 2010 or later MacBook Pro, it carries the audio feed as well as the video feed!  In my testing, this feature works exactly as advertised with one major caveat- the sound is in stereo, not 5.1 Dolby Digital!!!On a 2009 MacBook Pro, the dongle provides a perfect HDMI conversion with no audio present (this is expected behavior).  With a 2010 MacBook Pro, my attached Sharp Aquos TV showed up in the sound settings control panel as an audio output device.  When I selected this device, the sound came through perfectly with no additional cables!  This is a great feature and one that I greatly appreciate for new MBPs.  Saddly when I tried this same test on my Denon AVR, all multi-channel sound was lost and squashed into stereo sound.  Disappointing!If you have a 2009 or older MacBook Pro, it would be foolish to spend this much money for a mini display port to HDMI adapter.  And truth be told, for half of the price of this adapter, you can have a 5.1 optical audio cord and mini display port to HDMI video adapter.  For those cases where you need the sleekest/easiest setup and are playing through stereo speakers (like on a TV), this is definitely the way to go!As with other minidisplay port to HDMI adapters I\\'ve used, the video connection works immediately when plugged into the TV.  I\\'m always impressed by how well my Mac handles this type of thing.  I plug it in, and up pops Mac screen on my TV.  Once I setup audio the first time, that too worked when I plugged the HDMI cord into this adapter.This product would be 5 stars if it carried 5.1 audio.

      "{'text': \"on the go\\nI've had this Seagate drive for about two months and it works well for providing access to music and videos on my iPhone.  I loaded the Seagate with movies and music and carry the drive around with me when I'm going somewhere.  As long as I have it with me, I can listen to the music or watch the movies, with no wires, and without a power outlet.  At 1 TB, this drive holds 30 times more content than what I can store directly on my iPhone so I'll never run out of space.PROs---------------+ USB3 connectivity for fast file copies+ 1TB holds a lot of movies and music+ Very easy to access from your iOS devices+ Battery powered+ WiFi hotspot so you can use even when there is no WiFiCONs---------------- When directly connected to your computer, only supports NTFS (which isn't native on Mac, requires add-on driver)- When connected to drive, I was never able to access other networks using the WiFi pass-thru featureSETUP---------------Because uploading large media files over WiFi would take a really long time, I began by attaching this drive to my Windows 7 laptop and copying over some media files.  I used a USB 3 port and file transfer was far faster than I'm accustomed to with USB 2.  Moving files over was as simple as dragging them from Windows onto the drive.  To do the same on a Mac requires you to install an NTFS driver (provided by Seagate on the drive).  This works fine, but every time MacOS updates, you'll have to wonder if the driver has broken and needs upgrading.  I'd really prefer if they found a way to do this on Macs without a custom driver.As for wireless connectivity to your iPhone/iPad, it was easy to connect my iPhone to this drive.  I began by installing the Seagate Media App onto my phone.  I then changed my phone to use a new WiFi network that was created by the hard drive.  From there, I launched the Seagate Media app and all of my files were visible.  I could click on any of them to play them on my phone.Because the Seagate generates its own WiFi hotspot, you can access your media even when you're on the road.  In fact, because the drive has a battery, this is a completely wireless solution that works ANYWHERE.  Pretty cool.GENERAL---------------The range seemed pretty good.  I've only used this when in the same room with the drive (drive in backpack, phone in hand) but have had no problems connecting to the drive over WiFi.  The drive is always visible when I look for it and files stream fine without any hiccups.The drive has a WiFi pass-thru feature where you can have the drive connect to your home or hotel network and then you can surf the web/read e-mail through the ad-hoc network provided by the drive.  This is an important feature for me but one that I was never able to get working (hence only 4 stars).If you're on the road a lot and have a lot of digital media, this drive is a great solution.

So far I\\'m very pleased with the outcome.  The Garmin Nuvi 3490LMT is everything that I have been waiting for.  It has a gorgeous screen that is easily visible in all lighting conditions.  It quickly acquires my GPS location.

      "{'text': 'A few kinks, average sound quality\\nThis speaker is a handsome \"wireless\" speaker with good sound and support for Apple\\'s AirPlay technology.  The reason that I refer to it as \"wireless\" is that it does have a power cable so you\\'ll still have one wire no matter what!SETUPWhile AirPlay couldn\\'t be easier to configure, before you can have AirPlay, you\\'ll need to get this speaker configured onto your wireless network.  The AD7000W comes with a huge color getting started guide to help you add it to your wireless network.  One complaint about the getting started guide is that the instructions were cluttered up with 6 different languages so it was hard to figure out where the English text for the next step was without hunting around a bit.I tried both mechanisms for configuring my wireless support and had mixed results.  When I tried following the wifi configuration using my iPhone, it could not connect to my wireless network.  The unit doesn\\'t give you any good feedback as to what went wrong so I repeated the setup instructions a second time and got the same result- it didn\\'t work.Fortunately, when I tried the second method, using the WPS feature, it worked on the first try.  Truly, anyone with WPS support on their wireless network should have tried that first as it is by far the easiest way to join a wireless network.  You simply push a button on the back of the speaker and then push a button on your wireless router.  The rest is automatic.Once you have wifi working, the Philips speaker shows up on your AirPlay list without any additional configuration.  This is the beauty of Apple.SOUND QUALITYSound quality is about average for a speaker of this size.  I do not use the word \"average\" as a compliment or a complaint.  It is very loud but as you turn it up, the already-paltry bass disappears.  At about the 50% volume setting, bass is somewhat well balanced with the rest of the sounds.  Highs are not terribly crisp but they\\'re not too mushy either.  As with many speakers, positioning the speaker against a wall or in a corner noticeably improves the bass performance.Sound quality was significantly better when the iPhone was connected directly which makes me wonder if the AirPlay protocol is doing a bunch of extra compression.OPERATIONAirPlay worked great from my iPhone running iOS 5.  Immediately after configuring wifi on the speaker, it showed up in my AirPlay list.  I selected it and sounds started soon thereafter.  In a couple of hours of listening, I have yet to have any hiccups or disconnects in the audio; it\\'s worked flawlessly.  Right now I have the speaker in my home office in close proximity to my wireless network but when I try other locations, if I find problems, I\\'ll update this portion of my review.One neat feature of all AirPlay devices is that you can control the volume from your iOS device.  This speaker is no different.  Although it has voume +/- buttons on the back, you won\\'t want to use them because they\\'re hard to find and are right next to the power button (easy to turn it off).  To adjust volume, simply adjust the volume slider on your iOS device.  Very slick.Unlike some other personal speakers, this one does not have a built-in rechargeable battery.  That somewhat limits the ability to just pick it up and carry it off into the back yard with you.  I\\'d appreciate a rechargeable battery, even if it was only good for an hour or two.I tried to listen to this through the auxiliary \"mp3-link\" port but it never worked.  Honestly, I\\'m not too concerned about this since who would buy an expensive speaker like this only to hook it to the headphone jack of their phone?  But I am curious why it doesn\\'t work!FIDELIO iOS APPI liked the idea of being able to adjust the speaker sound profile (I wanted to turn up the bass!) so I installed the Fidelio app from the app store.  It is a total piece of garbage and really tainted my view of this product.  It crashed a couple of times and crashed/rebooted the speaker twice.  I never did get the app to work in any way and eventually gave up after 20 minutes of experimenting.  What a joke.  This feature took the speaker from 4 stars down to 3 stars.If they update the app and it starts working, I\\'ll update my review.APPEARANCEI usually wouldn\\'t dedicate an entire section to \"appearance\" but this thing is really nice looking.The speaker is about 12 inches wide by 7 inches tall.  It has a curved front and curved back so it should fit pretty nicely in a corner.It has a brushed metal cover on the top that looks very high end.  The rest of the speaker is understated.  Even the rear is nice looking- a glossy black with two bass ports.  The main detractor from the appearance is the power cord with fairly large (and ugly) black power brick.  I guess you can\\'t have it all!MISCELLANEOUSThe AD7000W consumes no power when turned off and 3 watts when on but idle.  Only in the \"on\" state does the AD7000W appear in the AirPlay list.  This means that you have to leave it powered on all the time unless you\\'re willing to go press the power button on it before you start playing your tunes.When playing AirPlay music at maximum volume up to 10 watts are consumed.  Playing the same music through the USB port (which simultaneously charged my iPhone) consumed 15 watts.Overall I think 3 watts is very reasonable for on/standby performance.  I wish it was closer to 1 watt but the speaker has to keep participating on the wifi network which surely consumes a good portion of that 3 watts.  4-10 watts when listening to LOUD music is very good.There are two errors on the product specifications as of December 2011.  First, Amazon\\'s listing states that this unit is \"battery powered\".  That is not the case- this unit does not have a battery.  Second, this unit states that this product comes with a remote control.  That is incorrect, no remote control is included (nor does one make sense since AirPlay is the remote!)SUMMARYMost AirPlay speakers cost more than this one by at least $50 to $100.  I know that B&W; and Klispch makes an AirPlay speaker for about triple the cost and I suspect they both have much better sound.I would have given this product 4 stars for its feature set and sound quality if everything had worked perfectly.  I\\'m fatigued by companies releasing not quite ready products and requiring customers to suffer for months while they work out the kinks.  In the case of the Fidelio app, that appears to be exactly what happened.  The sad thing is that the Fidelio app is not even integral to the usage of this speaker.  But the miserable experience with the Fidelio app combined with the inability to get it to join my wireless network without using WPS has me giving this 3 stars.If anything important changes, I will update my review.

      "{'text': 'Got worse over time...\\nUPDATE:With the update to the 3.x firmware, I can no longer use this device.  Every time it powers on it forgets the screen resolution and defaults to a resolution that my TV cannot display.  I can (navigating blind) get to the menu to force component output to 1080i@60hz, but as soon as I turn it off, it will revert to something else that my old TV can\\'t understand.The Hulu Plus app launches but also immediately changes the resolution to something that my TV can\\'t understand (why?).Finally, the vimeo app causes the box to crash and restart after about a minute of attempted usage.  Whereas the Boxee Box I maligned in my original review has gotten better with updates, this product has gotten worse.  I will be removing the hard drive and using it for some other purpose and the rest of this box is going in the trash.  What a waste.ORIGINAL REVIEW:WD Live Hub Media Center is my second foray into Internet-connected television.  My first was the terrible (but improving) Boxee Box.  This product is a big step in the right direction however still falls short of my most recent purchase: Apple TV.Three features drew me to the WD Live Hub Media Center.  The first was that it has Netflix support.  This isn\\'t really much of a feature to tout nowadays- every competing product has Netflix.  I found the Netflix implementation to be perfectly adequate- playback was comparable to other devices in my house and I was pleased to find that the \"play/pause\" button on the remote actually works with Netflix (unlike the Boxee Box!).  Netflix picture quality streamed over my 3Mbps DSL connection was excellent and every bit as good as my DirecTV high definition picture.The second feature that drew my interest was the inclusion of component video ports.  Most of the latest products in this category only allow for HDMI cables.  The problem is that there are many of us \"early adopters\" that still have TVs with component input and no HDMI.  Apparently it is illegal to sell HDMI to component video converters in this country which means those old TVs are slowly being deprecated by the industry.  Fortunately, the folks at Western Digital felt it was reasonable to include component ports.  I had some trouble getting component configured on my old HDTV because it couldn\\'t understand the default signal.  I took attached the WD to another TV and forced the configuration to send 1080i@60hz and took it back into the other room: problem solved!  A few weeks later I figured out I could have done this through the web browser interface.The device has a 1TB hard drive which is the third feature that I was looking forward to.  I copied all of my iTunes library to the device after setting up it\\'s network share.  The Live Hub Media Center became somewhat unusable during this process.  I was watching a movie on Netflix and it kept freezing while the LED on the front of the unit would start blinking.  This goes along with my comments below about the CPU being underpowered.Unfortunately, once I got my music onto the device, I found no good way to make use of it.  If only I could have played my playlists.  But sadly, it could only see individual music files & directories- I have too many ripped CDs for that to be useful.  In the end, this means I have a 1TB hard drive stuck on my home network with nothing practical to do with it.  This is a minor shortcoming since the Apple TV and Boxee Box can\\'t do that either.  In the end though, I haven\\'t found any good use for that 1TB drive sitting on my network.OTHERThe remote control is a good size and has buttons for commonly required functions such as play/pause, fast forward/rewind, menu/settings and a numeric keypad.  It is IR which means you can use your universal remote to replace it - very handy.  One thing that is tough is entering in any type of alphabetic values.  Typing my e-mail address to sync with my flickr account was painful and took forever using the clumsy input mechanism.  This is the only area where the Boxee Box is vastly superior to the competition (it\\'s remote control has a keyboard).I appreciate the \"favorites\" button on the remote.  This lets me get into Netflix with only a couple of clicks.  If only I could get all of these devices to turn on in the same app I last used them in like when I turn on my TV and it goes back to the channel I was watching when I turned it off.The CPU on this device seems a bit out-classed compared to the competition.  When I press a button on the remote, there is an annoying delay.  This can sometimes cause you to end up pressing a button twice and going too far.  It isn\\'t as terrible as some devices I\\'ve used but it is definitely a big step behind the Boxee Box and Apple TV.ACCESS FROM APPLE TVWhile the music that I uploaded to the WD Live Hub Media center did show up in iTunes on my Mac, it was completely unavailable from Apple TV.  This further reduced the utility.  Of course, I don\\'t expect most people to mismatch components as I have done- most people would buy additional Western Digital devices for other TVs in the house and I\\'m sure it works great that way.I was unable to pair Apple\\'s \"Remote\" application with the iTunes server on the device.  This meant I couldn\\'t search or play songs on any of the airplay enabled devices in my house.  I know that is Apple\\'s world- but this thing advertises itself as having an \"iTunes server\" but in reality, it\\'s not the same as the iTunes that you have on your computer.The software on the box is fairly stable.  I\\'ve had it crash twice in moderate usage.  Both times, the unit reset and came back up in about a minute or less.  I\\'m sure this will improve with time.I haven\\'t heard any noise from the WD Live Hub Media Center.  I\\'m sure the hard drive is making some noise but it\\'s been too quiet for me to notice so far.My original take on this product was that it was solid 3-star product.  After using the Apple TV, for my needs I found this product to be not nearly as attractive.  The Apple TV is so much better than what Western Digital has put together that it is hard to justify the 3-stars.  Once exposed to a product that is so vastly superior (Apple TV), the best I can give this product is 2-stars.  If I could find some useful purpose for the 1TB hard drive on my network (even to do time machine backups), it would immediately jump to 3-stars.
